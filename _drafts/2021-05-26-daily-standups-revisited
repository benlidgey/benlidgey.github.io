# Daily scrums revisited

In []() I talked about a debate and trial we have been having where we have swapped daily scrum calls (as we are working remotely) for status updates in the team chat channel as most of the team viewed the daily scrum as an interruption rather than something delivering value.

# My observations

I have not been collecting stats (perhaps I should have, but that felt too draconian and not trusting). So anecdotally I have noticed a significant drop in status updates from the team, and therefore an increase in nudges and less subtle "what's going on?" messages in the chat channel. Updates are not made in the ticketing system as an alternative either.

Scrum works on the basis of an empirical approach of transparency, inspection and adaptation. Without a regular update on progress towards the sprint goal and any impediments in the way, transparency is reduced, meaning inspection and adaptation is also limited.

The project has had challenges on a number of fronts including changes in product owners, customers, and a historical focus on technical goals that often competes with the customer needs. I feel the team needs reminding of the business benefits of the work, and a daily scrum would provide a regular opportunity to ask the question "how are we progressing towards the sprint goal and the wider business goals?". The technical focus of the work and an old backlog in need of TLC means the stories are often more like tasks.

All this adds up to status updates in the chat becoming one-liners like "working on this story (task)" which are delivering no real value to the team, and providing support (perhaps confirmation bias related) to the idea that daily scrums are a waste of time.

# What next?

The important thing is to keep the focus on delivering value to the business and team engagement and wellbeing. This does not mean finding a way to bring back daily scrums for the sake of it, but if they are a way to overcome some of those impediments and improve the productivity then that's something to be worked on. Efforts around team engagement and highlighting the purpose of the daily scrum in focusing on the goals, not as a micro-management tool may be a start.

This article on [Doubling Down on Scrum Fundamentals Helps Remote Teams Thrive](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/doubling-down-on-scrum-fundamentals-helps-remote-teams-thrive) introduces some thoughts on remote working issues with Scrum teams, including bringing in more synchronous communication as a way of improving communication within the team and as a way to help with mental health and wellbeing issues for people feeling isolated as a result of remote working during the COVID pandemic. The article also reinforces the importance of revisiting the sprint goal regularly.

As ever, it is a case of inspect and adapt. I think we need more transparency.
