# Burndowns in real life

This week I have been taking part in Movember 150 to support men's health week. The aim is to cycle 150km between 14th and 20th June. So being the agile nerd I am I decided to plan my progress during the week and track my progress using some agile techniques.

# Backlog

I have a fixed delivery date of 20th June. Measuring my value in km I need to deliver a fixed scope/value of 150km by that date. I have a fixed team capacity too (just me). That doesn't give me any flexiblilty in the overall scope -- my "[iron triangle](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/agile-iron-triangle)" is well and truly double-butted welded.

Looking at it a different way though, the high-level requirements are to "deliver" 150km; how this is achieved is still up to me. So I planned a backlog of routes and rides over the week that would add up to the 150km. 

I started with the aim of scheduling Zwift meetups so other people can join, and so the choice of routes was not limited to those that are allocated on specific days in Zwift. As it turned out there were few takers for the meetups and I felt it was better to ride in the daily worlds with other people rather than alone on a meetup. This required backlog refinement of routes during the week to adjust the planned routes to others in the allocated worlds.

# WIP limits

My team size is 1 (me). So I can only cycle one route at a time, therefore my in progress WIP limit is 1.

# Inspection

I set up a couple of Google Doc spreadsheets -- one for the backlog of rides and one to track the actual ride length and plot the burndown so I could see if I was on track to cover the distance for the week.

# Ride on!

I started out with all the determination and energy on Monday 14th with the short ride first thing in the morning, and a longer ride in the evening. My energy lasted into Tuesday morning with another gentle ride to keep the kms ticking over. So far so good -- just over 1 day in and 41km done.

Typically the weather was very hot as we had a little June heatwave, so that took more of a toll on me than I had planned. I had to take a break. Time to inspect and adapt. I reviewed the "backlog" of planned routes and dropped the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning rides to give me some time to recover, and adjusted the routes for later in the week so that I was still on track to meet the 150km by Sat 19th to give some contingency.

The hot sunshine went away on Wednesday afternoon to be replaced by more humidity. Wednesday's ride was probably not the best idea to do the "Figure 8 Reverse" around Watopia that included two KOM sections, as I reflected in my retrospective on Wednesday evening. I needed another rest. More inspection and adaption.

Looking at the burndown I had now covered 89km after 3 days so still tracking well on the burndown, so missing a ride on Thursday morning should be OK. Let's continue at a sustainable pace and not burnup (see what I did there!). More backlog refinement to remove the Thursday morning ride and juggle the later rides to match the Zwift worlds, taking into the account the distances and climbs (no more KOMs!).
