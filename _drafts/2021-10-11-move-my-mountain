# Move my Mountain

## My story

Ten years ago my son, who was 4 at the time, jumped on me and landed in a sensitive area. After a few days the aches and pains had not gone away, and instead I noticed a strange lump. I was taking part in Movember and that gave me the courage to go to the Doctor, who sent me for a scan, and I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Fortunately as this was found quickly I only needed surgery to sort out the physical issues. However, this made me really think about what is valuable and important in my life, and even then the mental stress continued for a long time afterwards.

## Too many men die young

These days, pandemic or otherwise, everyone has their own challenges. Men typically are not great at sharing feelings, issues and challenges with others. In the UK:

* 1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and each year more than 11,000 men die from prostate cancer.
* Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men. In most cases, the outcome is positive, but a 95% chance of survival is no comfort to the 1 man in 20 who won’t make it.
* The mental health challenges are also massive. Each year in the UK alone, more than 4,300 men die by suicide – 3 out of 4 suicides are by men. In the UK 12 men a day take their own life.

Movember is the leading charity dedicated to changing the face of men's health around the world. Our fathers, partners, brothers and friends are facing a health crisis that isn’t being talked about. We want men to take action to live happier, healthier, longer lives. We do this by investing in these critical areas: prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and suicide prevention.

Movember can encourage people to open up about their own issues. Over two fifths (43.5%) of Mo Bros said they had confided in a friend about their problems (compared with 18.3% from the general male population that had confided with a friend, colleague or family member) while nearly three in 10 (28.2%) have spoken to a healthcare professional about their mental health, all within the last year (compared with 16.1% of males from the general male population).

# Everyone has their own mountain to climb

Exercise is a great way to unwind, destress and relax. Doing it socially and with others can help too.

Research from Movember showed that over a third of Mo Bros exercised at least 20 times in the last month (compared with 22.2% of the general male population who say they have been physically active for 30 minutes or more, more than 20 times).

# My own mountain climb challenge

As a nerd (and a bit of a wimp when it comes to cold and wet weather if I am honest), I am intending to cycle up 8,848m (the equivalent height of Mount Everest) on the online cycling platform Zwift over November.

I will share my progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benlidgey), [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/5655569) and on my Movember page at
[Ben Lidgey's Mo Space](https://uk.movember.com/mospace/1435308) with updates on personal reflections on my favourite hills and mountains when I reach those summits.

I have been selected as a Movember sports ambassador, and will be running a number of open sessions for people to join in as much of a social, online ride with me as they want on different Zwift courses through Italian villages to mountain passes each week. We can chat online about whatever we fancy, and take in the (virtual) sights.

# Move your own mountain?

Why not set your own mountain target to climb in Movember? That can be as yourself, in a group or as a team. How you want to achieve it is also up to you – it can be walking :couple:, running :runner:, cycling :bike:, some other way or a combination.

If you want to grow a Mo like some famous explorers have, then go for it!

Here are some ideas:

* Vaalserberg - 321m
* Yr Wyddfa or Snowdon - 1,085m
* Kīlauea (my personal favourite) - 1,247m
* Ben Nevis - 1,345m
* Mont Blanc - 4,810m
* Mount Kilimanjaro - 5,895m
* K2 - 8,611m
* Mount Everest - 8,848m

No matter how you Move, your support will change the face of men’s health. With your help, we can reach our goals of reducing the number of men dying prematurely by 25% and halving the number of deaths from prostate and testicular cancer by 2030 by raising awareness through information on [Movember](http://movember.com/) .
