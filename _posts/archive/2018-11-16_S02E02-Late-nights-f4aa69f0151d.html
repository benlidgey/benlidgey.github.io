He has shown great self-confidence to perform in front of 1000 people for 4 shows, despite being really tired. He has been an inspiration.</p><figure name="8020" id="8020" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*S_2lMXmtUhCP1DC10nShSA.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="900" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S_2lMXmtUhCP1DC10nShSA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://twitter.com/CardiffGangShow" data-href="https://twitter.com/CardiffGangShow" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/CardiffGangShow</a></figcaption></figure><p name="c911" id="c911" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Had a good meeting at the x-Gov Agile Community of Practice for South Wales at the DVLA, with colleagues from ONS also there. There were good discussions on how the different teams are structured and work, some around looking at scaling. It was a good discussion and a community that can grow.</p><p name="a807" id="a807" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today I was part of a Digital Services strategy away day at The Wallich homeless charity offices. We talked about the challenges we have as a Digital Services team, some thoughts on what to do, and some actions to take away. A lot of the discussions were around culture and agile discipline, both of which I think are critical to getting right in order to deliver high-quality working software.</p><h4 name="fa5d" id="fa5d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Learning things</h4><p name="8c34" id="8c34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Learnings from this week:</p><p name="ffd6" id="ffd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Agile coaches are in DVLA and ONS. They are bigger organisations, but they provide value not only to the digital teams, but to the organisation as a whole. It is something we should look at too.</p><p name="2f0c" id="2f0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Doing something you clearly enjoy means you can overcome any obstacles that may stop you doing it (like my son at the Gang Show). There are some things I enjoy doing, but don’t get to do enough. Does that mean I really enjoy them enough to make them happen?</p><p name="700c" id="700c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Buses are slow.</p><h4 name="a9ce" id="a9ce" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Next steps</h4><p name="9611" id="9611" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There should be time for doing things I like outside of work. I enjoy cycling but have some reservations as going for a ride on my bike makes my back hurt. Now there is room in the garage I will set up the turbo trainer and see if I can tweak my bike to reduce the back pain.</p><p name="73d1" id="73d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I need to try a Next Bike.</p></div></div></section>
