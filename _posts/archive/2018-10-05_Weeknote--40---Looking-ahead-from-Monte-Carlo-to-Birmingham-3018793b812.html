Last week I ended my Weeknote #39 with some thoughts on what I was looking forward to this week. I said:

I said:</p><p name="fd89" id="fd89" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Looking forward to going on a bike ride with my daughter on her newly-serviced bike.” This didn’t happen as the weather and a lack of time got in the way. They are feable excuses, and some better planning should make it happen.</p><p name="1839" id="1839" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Catching up with my childhood buddy who is coming over this weekend.” We had a good weekend with Rob and Claire. We saw the movie “The house with the clock in its walls” which was OK, a bit quirky, but not one I would rush to watch again.</p><p name="a41b" id="a41b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Having a normal week without travelling all over the place.” This has happened as I have stayed at home and work. Next week will include more travelling to DeliverCon 2018.</p><h4 name="4c7b" id="4c7b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Monday</h4><p name="c8f1" id="c8f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I had a very useful roadmap planning session with the team. We did some story mapping to get a better understanding of what we need to do, with more effort on the medium term roadmap items, and less effort on the longer term items as they are more uncertain. We then used T-shirt sizes for planned features, using relative sizing based on the features that have already been completed.</p><figure name="05dc" id="05dc" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LkxUWWuLl0OsPMQNVPKXjg.jpeg" data-width="169" data-height="300" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*LkxUWWuLl0OsPMQNVPKXjg.jpeg"></figure><p name="48b7" id="48b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This gave me some figures to get an initial feel for the amount of work. A simple calculation came out as 10 years (yes really). I then used the Monte Carlo forecasting method which also came out at 10 years (yes really).</p><h4 name="18b3" id="18b3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tuesday</h4><p name="f978" id="f978" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The main focus for Tuesday was revising the forecasts from Monday and looking at the implications for how Digital Services could be organised to support a more DevOps aligned structure.</p><h4 name="e3db" id="e3db" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Wednesday</h4><p name="888f" id="888f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Wednesday was a mish-mash of sprint planning, some blockchain thoughts, and looking at how we can implement a hackathon day to showcase the benefits of an agile approach and the benefits of focussing on a single problem and completing it. This will need a full team including business stakeholders, Scrum team and Release/Support people all working together.</p><h4 name="1bb0" id="1bb0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Thursday</h4><p name="7867" id="7867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I had fun on Thursday running a little Agile workshop for people with no agile experience on the importance of prioritising backlogs on value, what does value actually mean, and finishing with a quick “Sinking ship/Game of 35”.</p><p name="5194" id="5194" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The day finished with me giving a presentation to non-technical members of the Portfolio Board on “what is DevOps” and why we should do it. It was a good exercise for me in really focussing on who the audience are and tailoring the content to their meet their needs. It is easy to jump into technical and process details, referencing WIP limits, value stream maps, build pipelines and more without getting the benefits across. The feedback I had in and after the meeting was very positive, with everyone understanding the benefits and the importance of the cultural alignment.</p><figure name="d26a" id="d26a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*z-PJHTSEPpzFldHVhrSFBg.png" data-width="378" data-height="213" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z-PJHTSEPpzFldHVhrSFBg.png"></figure><h4 name="3ece" id="3ece" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Friday</h4><p name="3e12" id="3e12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Friday was a working from home day as I had a Dr appointment in the morning. Unfortunately I left my Macbook power supply at work. For reasons I am yet to fathom the work policy is to not allow access to web-hosted applications from non-work laptops. Fortunately the things I had to complete for drafting thoughts on DevOps strategies could be done on non-work laptops so it was not too restrictive.</p><h4 name="4d2b" id="4d2b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Thoughts</h4><p name="936b" id="936b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I have been trying to read at least one article from my reading list on Medium a day, and by doing that I have found some useful things this week.</p><div name="f93e" id="f93e" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/@antweiss/understanding-feedback-loops-in-devops-e93b92b74bd1" data-href="https://medium.com/@antweiss/understanding-feedback-loops-in-devops-e93b92b74bd1" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@antweiss/understanding-feedback-loops-in-devops-e93b92b74bd1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Understanding Feedback Loops in DevOps</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Today I want to talk about what is probably the most misunderstood concept in DevOps terminology : the feedback loops.</em>medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/@antweiss/understanding-feedback-loops-in-devops-e93b92b74bd1" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="420e7c554017ace5e220aeb5c5cc3afb" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*Xvbwo1admJ4Lt9vS9kpa3w.png" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*Xvbwo1admJ4Lt9vS9kpa3w.png);"></a></div><div name="fa30" id="fa30" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"><a href="https://medium.com/@cote/roles-and-responsibilities-for-devops-and-agile-teams-fdacbffb4cb4" data-href="https://medium.com/@cote/roles-and-responsibilities-for-devops-and-agile-teams-fdacbffb4cb4" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@cote/roles-and-responsibilities-for-devops-and-agile-teams-fdacbffb4cb4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Roles and Responsibilities for DevOps and Agile Teams</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">This is a relativly done draft of a white paper I’ve been working on.
