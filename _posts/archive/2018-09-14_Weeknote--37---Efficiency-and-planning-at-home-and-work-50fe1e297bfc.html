Spice of life and all that.</p><h4 name="bda2" id="bda2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Monday</h4><p name="8ea8" id="8ea8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">At work we continually monitor our efficiency, and have a public target to make 3.5% efficiency savings. DevOps can provide a lot of efficiency in reducing rework, error rates, and improving productivity for a start. So, I volunteered to be part of the Efficiency Forum, and we had our first meeting. We talked about the need to identify efficienceies from anywhere which can then be reviewed to see if they meet the criteria for the target. One example was as simple as reducing the amount of post that is sent by 1st class mail, and sending post by 2nd class as much as possible. The longer term aim is to reduce the amount of post sent at all, and do much more comms digitally.</p><figure name="ad70" id="ad70" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xD9vHfSZiBgTm/twitter/iframe" width="435" height="366" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/stop-pit-efficiency-xD9vHfSZiBgTm" data-href="https://giphy.com/gifs/stop-pit-efficiency-xD9vHfSZiBgTm" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://giphy.com/gifs/stop-pit-efficiency-xD9vHfSZiBgTm</a></figcaption></figure><p name="59ad" id="59ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">At home I also made some efficiency savings by reviewing the Virgin Media package we have, as we don’t watch all the TV channels in the package, and have some very high broadband speed that we don’t actually use. So I called Virgin and said I would like to switch to one of those packages and lower costs I found on some of the comparison sites. “Oh, no, they are for new customers only!” was the response, followed by me saying “I’ve been a customer for a very long time, so what is the best you can do otherwise I will leave”. After being on hold for what seemed like ages, I spoke to someone else who discussed the deals and reduced my monthly bill by a third. All of that took half an hour, which is a frustrating amount — loyal customers should not have to go through this pretend dance of threatening to quit to get a good deal. Companies should show respect to customers and give them a good deal all the time. I would be far more likely to stick with a company that does that. That would be much more efficient all round.</p><p name="c84b" id="c84b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not just Virgin Media that does that. Every year I go through the same faff with utility companies. home insurance and car insurance companies — I get a renewal quote that has sky-rocketed, call them up and sometimes they reduce the quote back down (why not just do that to start with), or if they can’t match it then I leave.</p><h4 name="f22c" id="f22c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tuesday and Wednesday</h4><p name="54ee" id="54ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I started putting in the shelving in our new room but got the wrong sizes of some shelves and not enough of the others, so now have to wait until next week for the delivery to the DIY store.</p><figure name="85dc" id="85dc" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xTiTnfRATMgU2tPkbe/twitter/iframe" width="435" height="245" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h4 name="4ba1" id="4ba1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Thursday to Friday</h4><p name="21e3" id="21e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We had several business plan sessions at work reviewing what has happened over the last 6 months. The main theme coming through is that there has been a big cultural change already, with far more collaboration across teams and departments.</p><p name="2b77" id="2b77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I watched the <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/resource/live-webinar/2018-accelerate-state-devops-report" data-href="https://www.cloudbees.com/resource/live-webinar/2018-accelerate-state-devops-report" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DORA State of DevOps webinar</a> and read the report. There are some very sensible metrics that we can start using to measure our efficiency at delivering working software and keeping live systems stable and available.</p><figure name="44dd" id="44dd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VHbLSTAVHiov-PQxS58KFw.png" data-width="2184" data-height="938" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VHbLSTAVHiov-PQxS58KFw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://devops-research.com/" data-href="https://devops-research.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://devops-research.com/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="746c" id="746c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We have also done more planning and backlog refinement on the DevOps work required, and got a much better view of the work and the sprint planning to move from a set of manual instructions to automated build scripts. I had to keep the focus at implementing the automated environment builds for the development environments initially as that is the high-priority work, and not get distracted by other “nice to haves”.</p><p name="6fd2" id="6fd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, the week ended with an online conference call for the Delivery Conf conference in October in Birmingham. The team of volunteers are planning all the things that need to be done, with the plan coming together. There is not much time left though!</p><h4 name="1ab5" id="1ab5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Next week</h4><p name="d53b" id="d53b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">Next week I will be looking at Wifi mesh routers at home to get a consistent and reliable Wifi connection throughout the house. And putting those damn shelves up finally.</p></div></div></section>
