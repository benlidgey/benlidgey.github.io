However there are many people and organisations who don’t agree. While we shouldn’t make changes for the sake of it, we all need to look at the value of potential changes.</p><p name="36b1" id="36b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Techniques like spikes, AB testing and proof of concepts can be used to try out changes to see if they increase value. But what is value? It will vary depending on the context. Using metrics can be a method to measuring change — defining a metric that makes sense to the context or organisation can then be used to compare the before and after values. This is often mentioned in areas such as DevOps as a way to support the culture of continual experimentation and learning. It is also a fundamental part of the Agile principles of “iterate, inspect and adapt”.</p><p name="66d0" id="66d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From what I’ve observed in my life in software engineering, there is a spectrum of change appetites within organisations, each with short-term and longer-term impacts.</p><p name="1ac1" id="1ac1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fearful of Change organisations really don’t like change, and actively try and avoid it. Often the technical debt builds up, slowing the rate of change and increasing the costs. While in the very short term value can be delivered, rapidly the silt builds up and the organisation struggles to stay afloat.</p><p name="6cf0" id="6cf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Change resistant organisations are aware of the need to change but take a lot of convincing that some change is needed (or needs to be investigated). Even then the arguments or evidence for change is rejected, or kicked into the long grass so as to not shake things up. In the very short term value can be delivered, but again the silt gradually builds up and the organisation starts to sink.</p><p name="79d1" id="79d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Change reluctant organisations are similar to change resistant organisations, but, as the name suggests, accept that change may be needed after a lot of persuasion. Again the changes that are made can be haphazard, based on who proposed a change and without strong measurements and reviews.</p><p name="a1c7" id="a1c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Change accepting organisations realise that change is needed and make some efforts to identifying area for change with ways for changes to be proposed, implemented and reviewed. There is some understanding of the benefits of looking at change, and some ways of adopting changes. Value is delivered and if enough change is made, or the right ones are made then the organisation can remain alive.</p><p name="34db" id="34db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Change embracing organisations are continually inspecting and adapting, based on solid metrics, and with well defined strategies and tactics for identifying and managing change (including decisions when not to change, or to postpone changes). In my view this is the right balance to take, as value is still regularly delivered and the organisation adapts to changing markets and continues to grow.</p><p name="84e3" id="84e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Change zealots take the idea of change too far. They are constantly changing things, tending to spend more time implementing changes than delivering day to day value. The danger here is that costs rise, delivery starts to drop and even radical changes can put customers off, eventually leading to falling profits.</p><p name="0e52" id="0e52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">While we need to be mindful of changing things for the sake of it, we all need to be continually inspecting and adapting, but not at the expense of delivering the value we already have. There needs to be a balance.</p></div></div></section>
