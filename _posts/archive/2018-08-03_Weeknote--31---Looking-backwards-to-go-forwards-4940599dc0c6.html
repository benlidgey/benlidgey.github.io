We had a retrospective focussing on what was slowing us down, holding us back, and getting in the way to achieving our goal using the “sailing ship” theme. It highlighted that there were some unforeseen calls on the team’s time that are hard to predict, but more importantly some unforeseen complications in the work, especially as there are a lot of new technologies and systems. This could be reduced by more backlog refinement, further spikes and design work. This is managed by the Definition of Ready and Definition of Done. Rather than go into it all here, I’ve written it up and will be publishing it soon.</p><p name="70ca" id="70ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite all the hot weather recently I never got back into cycling to work. However this week I decided that no matter what I need to get back on the bike. And so I cycled in on Thursday and Friday, got incredibly hot but enjoyed the ride.</p><figure name="2e17" id="2e17" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VwaRtzorj-qAtXuzRr1HAA.jpeg" data-width="615" data-height="410" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VwaRtzorj-qAtXuzRr1HAA.jpeg"></figure><p name="4051" id="4051" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">But why are buses so smelly? They go slowly, often pump out loads of noise and smelly clouds of fumes. People say public transport is good for the environment, and I can see the arguments in terms of carrying more people in a smaller space, reduction in traffic volumes and so on. But just imagine how much nicer the roads would be with quieter buses and far less black diesel smoke blowing out the back.</p><p name="31f7" id="31f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was really chuffed that Geraint Thomas won the Tour de France. He is such a down to earth athlete, humble and still an inspiration to many people, cyclists and otherwise. When he came to Maindy Flyers when my children were training he wandered in looking like any normal person (no flash cars, bodyguards, fancy clothes). He spoke to the kids in an honest way, answering questions on his cycling career, and which coffee he prefers. I loved his TdF speech as it clearly came from the heart, and was not a slick, prepared speech. His honesty and humble nature is one that I admire and recognise, and he still manages to compete at the highest level. That is something I will take inspiration from and try to do myself.</p><p name="1ab5" id="1ab5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally I was given my WRU pants (from Oddballs), as I have now been living in Wales for 20 years.
