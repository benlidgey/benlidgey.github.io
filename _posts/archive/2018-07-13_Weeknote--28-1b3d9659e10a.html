See <a href="https://medium.com/@benlidgey/weeknotes-or-weaknotes-5670aa5bb9ff" data-href="https://medium.com/@benlidgey/weeknotes-or-weaknotes-5670aa5bb9ff" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p><h3 name="8808" id="8808" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Positives</h3><p name="8ddc" id="8ddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In my role as a parent Governor I went to the primary school for a learning walk for ICT. The staff were very proactive, and the children from all areas of the school were incredibly engaged in using various forms of tech for all sorts of things. The green screen was popular with the children and staff alike as it made the learning experience so much more engaging. The use of ICT within lessons on other topics (I saw a video of children “swimming” with a great white shark) is just what we need for the next generation to be able to use tech without any concerns. Using “bee bots” taught the children about programming, but also about logical thinking and using feedback loops.</p><p name="22df" id="22df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The older children in KS2 were getting into Scratch programming, spreadsheet, databases and multimedia editing. Again this was embedded in lessons on other topics, which mirrors real life. We also talked about internet safety, and it was good to see their awareness of the issues.</p><p name="1f1c" id="1f1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overall I was very impressed with the school approach and the energy from the children, and given my involvement in the Welsh Gov ICT Steering Group, that eventually fed into the Donaldson report on updating the curriculum, it was good to see the ideas being implemented.</p><p name="fa1c" id="fa1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The loft conversion is coming along, with the main bedroom painting nearing completion.</p><h3 name="26d1" id="26d1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What did I learn?</h3><p name="639b" id="639b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are lots of positives happening in schools to prepare today’s children for the future.</p><p name="2441" id="2441" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Various conversations in and out of work also reinforced the need for everyone to continue to learn, and learning can be work-related or personal related. While it is easy to say, we all need to make time for this to happen.</p><p name="efc4" id="efc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a more risk-averse person, I have learned to have a go at things, to occasionally “throw caution to the wind” and have a go at stuff, and not be afraid to be honest with myself or others if it goes a bit wonky, as long as I review it and use the feedback to make changes.</p><h3 name="fb33" id="fb33" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What will I focus on next week?</h3><p name="1e77" id="1e77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">Next week I will focus on more work towards finishing the loft conversion, more personal learning, and cycling at least once (!) as that is something else I have not made happen recently.</p></div></div></section>
