Regardless of the units used for estimating (days, story points, t-shirt sizes) the important thing is to estimate an item relative to other ones. These articles describe the principles nicely:</p><p name="0023" id="0023" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/how-can-we-get-the-best-estimates-of-story-size" data-href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/how-can-we-get-the-best-estimates-of-story-size" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/how-can-we-get-the-best-estimates-of-story-size</a></p><p name="4819" id="4819" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation" data-href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation</a></p><p name="5eaa" id="5eaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have not been doing estimating that well, it varies between teams, so I am looking at using the impact-effort matrix as a way of getting people to think about the size and complexity of a task without getting dazzled by the actual numbers for story points.</p><p name="1bc5" id="1bc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The team can look at an item and discuss the value of it, and agree where it will go on the matrix. We could print the Jira tickets out and place them in a grid on a table for teams who are co-located (I will need to look at something that can be used remotely, perhaps a Jira plugin or a CardboardIt page). We can then “translate” the different boxes in the grid into story points.</p><p name="0cbc" id="0cbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, using a grid like this one, you can take each task and discuss how much effort is involved to write the tests and how complex is it to test. Something in the low-low box might then translate to 1 story point, where as the high-high might be a 13, several boxes might translate to the same values, for example low-med and med-low.</p><figure name="7b88" id="7b88" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Rwf3S8bZWctwx3jn.jpeg" data-width="875" data-height="571" alt="3 by 3 matrix on a whiteboard" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Rwf3S8bZWctwx3jn.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://medium.com/exploreux/the-3x3-impact-effort-matrix-e71ea5307d9f" data-href="https://medium.com/exploreux/the-3x3-impact-effort-matrix-e71ea5307d9f" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" target="_blank">https://medium.com/exploreux/the-3x3-impact-effort-matrix-e71ea5307d9f</a></figcaption></figure><p name="e345" id="e345" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This blog post on <a href="https://medium.com/exploreux/the-3x3-impact-effort-matrix-e71ea5307d9f" data-href="https://medium.com/exploreux/the-3x3-impact-effort-matrix-e71ea5307d9f" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">3x3 impact effort matrix</a> describes it for prioritising backlog items, but I think it works well for estimating too as it makes everyone think about the size and complexity.</p><h3 name="017a" id="017a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Documentation is important</h3><p name="1160" id="1160" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The importtance of documentation also came up again this week. There are a number of manual tasks that need to be done for the system support that are not documented, and some that are documented but stored in an old wiki that is now archived. Keeping documentation like “how to” guides up to date is hard enough, but impossible in an archived wiki. The challenge now is to unarchive it, and then go through to see which is still relevant.</p><h3 name="2461" id="2461" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cycling</h3><p name="ad1d" id="ad1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Last weekend I got up early-ish on Sunday and went for a bike ride. I had not been for a ride for a while, and it was nice to get out. There is a new housing estate near us that has closed one of the little back lanes that are good for cycling through. Fortunately it is closed to cars but not to bikes, I just hope it stays that way.</p><p name="a957" id="a957" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have also been keeping an eye on the Tour de France. I am always fascinated by the team work and tactics in Le Tour to control the race, and the judgements on how long to let breakaway groups go. G is planning the long game to retain the GC, and so is not too worried about different people winning the Maillot Jaune in the first few stages is also interesting. I just hope he hasn’t let Alaphillipe get too far ahead.</p><h3 name="8eef" id="8eef" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The World Cup</h3><p name="433e" id="433e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It was great to watch England winning the World Cup, and it was an amazing game. How 2 teams can bat for 50 overs each and the scores to come out level, and then bat for a super over and the scores to still come out level is amazing. The fact it came down to some luck (as is often the case in sport) is fine; the debate over the 6 runs from the deflection off Ben Stokes’ bat that should have been 5 runs is a shame as it takes the shine of the result. The way the Black Caps have conducted themselves in the face of that is absolutely inspirational. I would certainly support one of the suggestions that should the scores be tied again the World Cup should be shared.</p><h3 name="8048" id="8048" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">And finally</h3><p name="70b9" id="70b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I saw a heron walking around the lake with the dog. (I love the ambiguity in that sentence too). We are lucky to live somewhere where that can happen.</p><figure name="9396" id="9396" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*dZKC8irLPuqzM0dd" data-width="839" data-height="902" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dZKC8irLPuqzM0dd"></figure></div></div></section>
