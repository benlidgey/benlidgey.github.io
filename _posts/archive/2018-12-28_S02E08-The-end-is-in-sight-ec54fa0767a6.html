It is also in all intents and purposes the end of the year, and coupled with the quiet period has allowed me to reflect on 2018 and to look forward to 2019.</p><p name="3090" id="3090" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can see why people make New Year’s resolutions, even if the idea is (arguably) <a href="https://www.riskology.co/new-years-resolutions/" data-href="https://www.riskology.co/new-years-resolutions/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">flawed</a> and resolutions should be about setting achievable goals throughout the year, and not expecting to be the perfect whatever by the end of Jan.</p><p name="c25a" id="c25a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have always been a fan of OKRs as a better way to measure performance in something. Articles like <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/" data-href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ReWork Guide: Set goals with OKRs</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28" data-href="https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">The Fundamentals: OKRs</a> provide a good introduction. The 6 monthly appraisal process I have seen in many organisations is too irregular and can be patronising. Some of my recent objectives have been basically to “do my job”, although phrased to make it appear more useful.</p><h4 name="2471" id="2471" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Things from last week</h4><p name="edf8" id="edf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Got a whole lot of jobs done moving rooms last weekend. It was good to move tasks to the “done” column in my mental Kanban board.</p><figure name="ee42" id="ee42" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*QGKq6BNtGiLG31k6" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*QGKq6BNtGiLG31k6"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards" data-href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards</a></figcaption></figure><p name="743a" id="743a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Christmas Day felt like a bit of a non-event. Yes the kids enjoyed opening their presents, and were grateful for them (helped by encouraging them to contribute to a charity to buy a present for children who wouldn’t otherwise get anything). Family sickness meant that the day didn’t have the traditional feast which has been postponed until everyone is better and we can enjoy it properly.</p><p name="9a28" id="9a28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had a lovely Boxing Day walk on Ogmore-by-sea beach. There were loads of people who had the same idea, but we had a good exercise, and the dog had a good run about.</p><p name="19b4" id="19b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The car had its MOT and passed with no problems! The car tax (£0) also needed paying, so I had to do the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax" data-href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">user journey on the DVLA website</a>, despite not needing to pay anything. It did seem baffling, the only reason I could think of was that it confirmed that I still owned the car and that it wasn’t SORN.</p><h4 name="1600" id="1600" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Things I learned this week</h4><p name="f87b" id="f87b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I knew this already, but this week re-iterated it: Christmas is all hype. People use it as a reason to get together with people, but we should all get together with people we want to regardless of the time of year.</p><p name="fc44" id="fc44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Christmas has continued to increase the societal pressure to buy lots of stuff. We talked about that on the beach walk on Boxing Day. Every year we say we should go away to somewhere in the middle of nowhere for Christmas with a load of food, books and games and go “off-grid”, and every year we don’t. We really should make it happen in 2019.</p><p name="5469" id="5469" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ikea meatballs are nice, the lingonberry jam is also nice, and so is the gravy that comes with it.</p><h4 name="5954" id="5954" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Things for next week</h4><p name="628c" id="628c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The main point of the week is to have some good family time. That is the top priority.</p><p name="8d47" id="8d47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have stuff to do around the house (as always), but with the view to get the final rooms sorted out.</p><p name="5f3a" id="5f3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2018 has been a particularly difficult year for me, but things are turning around. I might take a look at the <a href="https://yearcompass.com/" data-href="https://yearcompass.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Year Compass</a> for 2019 to put the negatives behind me and focus on doing positive things in the next year.</p><p name="deb8" id="deb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe service my Brompton as it will be useful for commuting again soon. It needs new brake blocks, and the good old Sturmey Archer 3-gear hub might need a once over. I just need to figure out what to do.</p><p name="5e93" id="5e93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Set up the smart turbo trainer I had for Christmas and starting getting fit again, with the view to ride the Tour de Gwent in April. Going back to the concepts of OKRs I will set an initial objective of “Riding a sportive of at least 50 miles by the end of September 2019”. The Key Results will be “Ride 2 sessions of at least 1 hour a week on the Turbo trainer”, “Ride a weekend ride with the kids twice a month”</p><figure name="82ae" id="82ae" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*kCgmOsgUD3m8MuFS" data-width="3000" data-height="2003" data-unsplash-photo-id="FS3rUiCjJjY" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kCgmOsgUD3m8MuFS"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@filios_sazeides?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@filios_sazeides?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Filios Sazeides</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
