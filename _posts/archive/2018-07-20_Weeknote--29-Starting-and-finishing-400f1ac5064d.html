My son has had his leaver’s concert, and now left primary school. He is “in between” schools, so finishing at Primary school and thinking about starting High school. Also my daughter has finished another year at High school, and is starting to think about starting her final year at High school. So lots of starting, finishing, and starting to finish and finishing to start. Or something like that.</p><p name="b063" id="b063" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have also been looking at the starting and ending of things at work. As the Product Owner I have been refining the backlog. Clearing out old items from the backlog that are no longer relevant or have been around too long without anyone asking for them to be done. So finishing off (killing?) stories that have not started. Using the Control Chart in JIRA has helped with this to identify the outliers from the rolling average, and assessing which ones are still relevant and removing the others. This has cleared out some of the fluff and helped to identify those stories that need to be worked on soon. It also showed that the team’s cadence is becoming more consistent.</p><p name="fd99" id="fd99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have also been finishing (yep) my lightning talk about the link between fire and life, looking back at last year’s family holiday to Hawaii and how the Hawaiian islands have grown from the fire of volcanoes to hold such beauty and life, and how having such experiences with my family has created wonderful memories.</p><figure name="d447" id="d447" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*UgVf39VLcrJBX5lTAL96jA.jpeg" data-width="4000" data-height="3000" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UgVf39VLcrJBX5lTAL96jA.jpeg"></figure><p name="8c0a" id="8c0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">On a personal level I have had some great conversations with some great people this week. It has helped me to concentrate on my strengths and focus on the things I want to do both at work and in my personal life. I will be starting to finish some things, starting to start some things and finishing some things completely.</p><figure name="accc" id="accc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bjLC1ry5QIvMZmc1bgy5QQ.jpeg" data-width="628" data-height="355" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bjLC1ry5QIvMZmc1bgy5QQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="http://www.cricketcountry.com/news/record-setting-joe-roots-mic-drop-leaves-eoin-morgan-chuckling-727144" data-href="http://www.cricketcountry.com/news/record-setting-joe-roots-mic-drop-leaves-eoin-morgan-chuckling-727144" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.cricketcountry.com/news/record-setting-joe-roots-mic-drop-leaves-eoin-morgan-chuckling-727144</a></figcaption></figure><p name="506d" id="506d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Finally, there are a few sporting things that I enjoyed this week. Geraint Thomas has won 2 stages of the TdF (more finishing), and has the Yellow jersey. The one that has made me chuckle the most though is Joe Root’s “drop the mic” bat drop — such cheekiness and confidence all wrapped up together. A great blend for making the most of life.</p><p name="087f" id="087f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The end. Drop the mic.</p></div></div></section>
