I would recommend staying a Landmark Trust house as they are really well equipped, and a little bit different.</p><figure name="ca33" id="ca33" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*65Lhv0fzvVqKHRBat1GXTg.jpeg" data-width="2440" data-height="680" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*65Lhv0fzvVqKHRBat1GXTg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Lynton and Lynmouth</figcaption></figure><p name="44aa" id="44aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It seems like a good opportunity to start a new series of week notes, and to focus on positives and learnings I will try to talk about: good things that happened, things that I learned, and things to look at doing next week.</p><p name="78e3" id="78e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week I have got back into the swing of things at work and at home.</p><h4 name="424f" id="424f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Good things</h4><p name="6106" id="6106" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Started moving my daughter into her new bedroom. It was decorated while we were away, so when we got back we started to move things into the new room. This move was then paused this week while she did some GCSE exams, but will continue this weekend.</p><p name="7a59" id="7a59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Wednesday I ran a pre-mortem which I found to be very positive, despite the slightly scary name. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://medium.com/@benlidgey/a-tale-of-a-devops-pre-mortem-feb4e0002ede" data-href="https://medium.com/@benlidgey/a-tale-of-a-devops-pre-mortem-feb4e0002ede" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">A tale of a DevOps pre-mortem</a>.</p><h4 name="cf66" id="cf66" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Learning things</h4><p name="6ee0" id="6ee0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The pre-mortem was also a good learning opportunity. The team was small, so we tended to focus on the problems, and missed the opportunity to look at the “glass half full” side too — what do we need to do to make the work a roaring success.</p><p name="7d66" id="7d66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have also been experimenting with building Docker containers, and using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" data-href="https://travis-ci.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Travis CI</a> and <a href="https://codeship.com/" data-href="https://codeship.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeShip</a> in a project in <a href="https://github.com/benlidgey/coffee-shop" data-href="https://github.com/benlidgey/coffee-shop" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> based around a hypothetical system to allow pre-ordering in a coffee shop. I also used this project to highlight the benefits of TDD and BDD in a lecture I gave at Cardiff Met University in October. I found that there are some differences in the way Travis CI and CodeShip work, but overall they both provide a simple CI environment for small projects.</p><p name="5fc6" id="5fc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The CloudNative Wales meet up this week was very interesting, with talks from Netflix, auto-building developer IDE images, and how the maturity of AI development is lagging behind software development. I would like to have a go at the developer IDE images, and may do based on docker instead of vagrant. Not sure yet, one for the backlog.</p><figure name="4cec" id="4cec" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VSFNmADhub1GuCv78OvGoA.jpeg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VSFNmADhub1GuCv78OvGoA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Nat Morris at Cloud Native Wales</figcaption></figure><h4 name="8212" id="8212" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Next things</h4><p name="6ab4" id="6ab4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Next week is Gang Show week, so lots of running back and forth to the theatre to drop off and pick up my son. I don’t think there will be a lot of spare time, so I will have to use it wisely.</p><p name="1452" id="1452" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I want to keep going on the coffee shop project as a learning aid for me. The next focus is to implement the web front end and get that auto-deploying to a Docker container. I am not convinced that this will be done next week as the priority is still on sorting out things in the house redecoration.</p></div></div></section>
