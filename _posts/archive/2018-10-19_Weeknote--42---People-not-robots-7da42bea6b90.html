Here are some things I have done this week. As per the usual caveat I have done more than this.

It was funny and a no brainer which was what we expected, and in a funny sort of way highlights the difficulty the Bond producers have — Bond is getting a bit samey and cliche, which allows films like Johnny English to parody it. I did wonder what they could have done with a bit more suspense and less obvious disasters. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It is a good no-brainer for a Friday night though.</em></p><figure name="8f9a" id="8f9a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qvt4xZQElcY_yKQreOMZhA.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="1440" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qvt4xZQElcY_yKQreOMZhA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="http://www.johnnyenglishmovie.com/" data-href="http://www.johnnyenglishmovie.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.johnnyenglishmovie.com/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="b41f" id="b41f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">DIY work continues throughout the week with more work on redecorating bedrooms. While I am not great at DIY, and do not always enjoy it, things have gone fairly well this week. Shelves have been easy to put up (with only a couple of minor snags), and skirting board edging has been put on. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Evostik Mitre Mate is great stuff, although a bit scary at how quickly it sets.</em></p><p name="d0fe" id="d0fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Monday was my last day as a Parent Governor at Willowbrook Primary. I have been a Governor there since 2012, and seen the huge amount of work that happens behind the scenes. Lots of data analysis is done to measure and steer the direction of the school, predict the outcomes of phases, classes, cohorts and most impressively used to tailor the teaching for each child. It has also been great to see the changes proposed by the Welsh Gov ICT Steering Group (of which I was part) in 2013 being implemented strongly by the school. It was a difficult decision to make, but as I felt I couldn’t contribute enough time as a Governor it was right to step down and allow a fresh person to take my place. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It has been a rewarding and challenging experience for me, has taken me into a new world and ways of doing things which has helped me broaden my skills and experience.</em></p><figure name="cddb" id="cddb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Jq09NNojYhfNvPaqlmnx3g.png" data-width="700" data-height="394" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Jq09NNojYhfNvPaqlmnx3g.png"></figure><p name="f042" id="f042" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Monday was also the day I gave a lecture at Cardiff Met on the importance of automated testing. The lecture was to 2nd year students, who generally seemed engaged with some good questions at the end. While the content of the lecture focussed on the different types of automated testing (Unit, TDD, BDD, integration) with some basic examples of what they are, the underlying theme is still one about collaborating with people to understand the user needs and the problem that needs to be solved — without this understanding you will never be for testing the right things. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Despite automation the tests still need the human logic and critical thinking to define all the scenarios. Automation is just the mechanism to run the tests quickly and repeatedly.</em></p><p name="622d" id="622d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A lot of time at work has been working on the ways to improve the culture in the whole organisation towards a more collaborative, innovative and empowered one where people feel they can identify something that needs sorting (or is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bonkers</em> as the CEO calls it), and can find a way to make an improvement. This culture is also crucial at the Digital Services and DevOps levels to continually improve and iterate. In a similar way to test automation, you will never get quick, high quality, reliable builds and deployments if the general mindset is not one of small, incremental releases of working software that meets the needs of the whole system. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You can have the best super-sexy build infrastructure and pipelines, but you will only achieve great benefits if the culture is such that decent automated tests are being written by default for small changes, meeting coding standards, and designed in such a way to be released independently.</em></p><h4 name="f7b3" id="f7b3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Looking forward</h4><p name="71cc" id="71cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I had a great conversation today with Sarah from ONS about organising and running a Wales version of the DeliverCon 2018 unconference. We discussed what we liked from DeliverCon 2018, and where we felt we need to make changes based on learnings from it, and also to pick up some local needs. It is something we will carry on looking at doing, with an aim for something by the end of March 2019. If you are interested in being involved, let me know.</p><p name="4e1d" id="4e1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">DIY continues next week too. I haven’t quite created a physical Kanban board, but have one mentally where I try to focus on a limited WIP with some small achievable items of work. This coming week is getting the bedroom to a state where is can be used temporarily, and getting the restored dressing table in place.</p><p name="8114" id="8114" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also next week I am looking forward to the South Wales Agile Group meetup looking at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/South-Wales-Agile-Group/events/jvpblnyxnbhc/" data-href="https://www.meetup.com/South-Wales-Agile-Group/events/jvpblnyxnbhc/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Agile; The Next Generation — James Osborne from the National Software Academy</em></a></p><figure name="f330" id="f330" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*3bFTIu7TgTJ0Zt18" data-width="5760" data-height="3840" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3bFTIu7TgTJ0Zt18"><figcaption class="imageCaption">“cup with heart capuccino on table” by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lauramakoj?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@lauramakoj?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Laura Johnston</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
