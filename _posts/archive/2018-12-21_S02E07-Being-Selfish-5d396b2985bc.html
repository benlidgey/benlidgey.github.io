We put up the lights outside while the weather was dry (timing it perfectly — as we finished it pee’d down). This week we also wrapped some presents which is normally left until Christmas Eve. Hopefully that will mean Christmas Eve will be more relaxing.</p><p name="0e34" id="0e34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More DIY in bedrooms. Hoping to finish this phase this weekend.</p><p name="0c9c" id="0c9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My Mac decided to throw a hissy-fit about connecting to GitHub and SSH. In the end I went back to basics by removing all the keys and starting from scratch.</p><p name="8479" id="8479" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On a related note I have continued to experiment with Spring Boot and Spring Data storage. I still like the concept of Spring and as the support for functionality grows it makes sense to use it, hiding the mechanics for thing like connecting to databases or REST services, and concentrating on the business logic. The only thing that seems to get in the way are the different ways to do something, like implementing Cucumber tests, with Spring or Spring Boot.</p><h4 name="fcaf" id="fcaf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Five things I learned this week</h4><p name="5039" id="5039" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It has been good to get back into technical work. It is something that I have not been doing as much of as I would have liked recently, focussing more on the Agile/DevOps processes. However over the past few weeks I have been reviewing what I enjoy doing — my conclusion is that I enjoy making and delivering digital solutions which require the right mix of Agile, DevOps and technology.</p><p name="b69b" id="b69b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As part of this review I have resigned from my current place to move to a new job that has a better mix of Agile, DevOps and tech. I have always felt like a bit guilty when going to interviews and applying for jobs. I have been pleasantly surprised by the congratulations I have had since resigning.</p><p name="b33a" id="b33a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is OK to be selfish sometimes. I have had feedback in the past that I can be “too nice” and “too helpful” and try to make things better for others, sometimes at my own expense. I will make a concerted effort to stop and check if I am being too nice before doing something, and to put myself higher up the priority list. I read an article somewhere that said it is OK to hate people (or something like that) — if you dislike someone then that’s fine, just be professional about it, but don’t think you have to try and be nice to them. There some slimey suckers in the world, and I won’t go out of my way to be nice and helpful to them anymore.</p><p name="7f9b" id="7f9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I cannot mitre cut wood very well, even if I have measured it twice.</p><p name="bd0b" id="bd0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apps like <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/" data-href="https://www.justwatch.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.justwatch.com/</a> can be good for searching across streaming services. It would be great to have an aggregated view of what is bookmarked in each of my streaming services. Also, streaming services look great, but given the crazy world of content rights it is annoying when I’ve bookmarked something to watch but when I get around to it, the content has expired. It makes having a DVR more appealing again.</p><h4 name="0a7c" id="0a7c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Things coming next</h4><p name="7319" id="7319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Finishing the DIY.</p><p name="0bd3" id="0bd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Car service.</p><p name="6e65" id="6e65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Migrate from Google Apps (that is just restricted and unloved).</p><p name="2e59" id="2e59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Christmas of course.</p><p name="06ff" id="06ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is a picture from our trip to Hawaii and the <a href="https://www.lovebigisland.com/big-island-manta-ray-night-dive/" data-href="https://www.lovebigisland.com/big-island-manta-ray-night-dive/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kona Manta Ray night snorkel</a> as it is much nicer that the crappy winter weather here.</p><figure name="589f" id="589f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Ew_crdrFCEFUDyeeKfZf2w.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ew_crdrFCEFUDyeeKfZf2w.png"></figure></div></div></section>
