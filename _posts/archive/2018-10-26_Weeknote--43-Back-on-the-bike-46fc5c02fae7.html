This week the weather has been cold but clear. I don’t know if that had an affect but I got out on my bike a lot more.

I don’t know if that had an affect but I got out on my bike a lot more.</p><figure name="c341" id="c341" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*UFlSRTyVskBY14cPToZaMA.jpeg" data-width="2160" data-height="3840" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UFlSRTyVskBY14cPToZaMA.jpeg"></figure><p name="b44e" id="b44e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">My 5 notable things this week are as follows.</p><h4 name="66e5" id="66e5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Getting out on my bike</h4><p name="92ab" id="92ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’ve already mentioned this, but I have now done 5 rides of differing types and distances this week. The first was a ride around the hilly lanes near my house which tested my stamina, the 2nd was a ride with my daughter around the flatter parts including a stopover for tea and brownies, and then the others were commuting to work and back.</p><p name="f1df" id="f1df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The commutes were timed well as there have been some horrible traffic jams this week. Once again it highlighted the need for joined up transport links in Cardiff, with very little in place for cycle routes, efficient bus routes (the buses get stuck in the traffic often), and no rail links despite the mainline running past my house.</p><h4 name="d888" id="d888" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">South Wales Agile Group</h4><p name="13a5" id="13a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">On Thursday I went to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/South-Wales-Agile-Group/" data-href="https://www.meetup.com/South-Wales-Agile-Group/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">South Wales Agile Group</a> meet up at Tramshed Tech to see a talk from James Osbourne from the National Software Academy. They have a very refreshing model of running a degree course “Applied Software Engineering” in an Agile way to train students in Agile and modern software techniques to be work-ready when they graduate. The most impressive thing for me was that the staff practice what they preach, and use tools such as retrospectives, feedback from their users (the students) to constantly review and iterate their course content.</p><h4 name="74eb" id="74eb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Culture workshops</h4><p name="1cee" id="1cee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The culture workshops continued at work this week, with a session looking at <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">change</em>. We had a quick presentation from Clare at MindGym on the change curve and the different personas for people managing change. For me it was the moment where we need to shift the focus of the people in the culture champions group from doing the changes to helping and facilitating others to make changes.</p><figure name="3065" id="3065" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_xy5oE4S5Wq3Lxam3Wu9fQ.jpeg" data-width="2063" data-height="2506" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_xy5oE4S5Wq3Lxam3Wu9fQ.jpeg"></figure><h4 name="22c2" id="22c2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">DevOps team re-focus</h4><p name="4637" id="4637" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This week we had a great demo and walkthrough from one of the Dev teams working on a payment service. They are keen to move their builds to the new build infrastructure we have put in place, but are wary of the risks of doing so to their deadlines (but in fairness are also aware of the benefits). At the same time I have been reviewing the amount of work the small DevOps team has on its plate, and by re-focussing the team to help and facilitate others to take a more DevOps approach, and provide the necessary build infrastructure, we can achieve more migration and adoption of the new infrastructure but more importantly get other teams on board with the whole DevOps way of doing things.</p><h4 name="1770" id="1770" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Mid year review</h4><p name="6b8a" id="6b8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I had my mid year review this week, which I don’t find useful. It is a box-ticking exercise every 6 months reviewing what happened but with little relevance to reality. I find regular reviews of progress and objectives on a fortnightly basis much more useful. There are similarities between Agile development in 2 week iterations, personal development in 2 week iterations (perhaps we should do demos and retrospectives), and the Agile approach taken by the National Software Academy.</p><h3 name="3e5e" id="3e5e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Frustrations</h3><p name="6df1" id="6df1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This week my main frustrations are:</p><p name="4543" id="4543" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Cardiff traffic is bad. This week it took me 55 minutes to drive 6 miles, and 25 minutes to cycle 6 miles. Cycling is good for my health, although I don’t like breathing in all the traffic fumes. You could say I am a hypocrite for driving and cycling, and I would probably agree.</p><p name="0861" id="0861" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I cannot get JUnit 5 and Cucumber to work together. I really like the BDD approach, but being stuck to JUnit 4, while not a problem, is frustrating. It seems both groups need to work together to get the benefits of both tools clearly available.</p><h3 name="f2a4" id="f2a4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Finish on a high</h3><p name="5962" id="5962" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Last Saturday we went to St Fagans for the afternoon as the weather was nice and we wanted to spend time together as a family. My son went on the high ropes course, and was behind some other children who were going a lot slower. So he decided to stay on a log about 20 feet above the ground, and without holding onto anything started flossing.</p><div name="ff86" id="ff86" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rNb8YzEVbJPhoVr27" data-href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rNb8YzEVbJPhoVr27" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rNb8YzEVbJPhoVr27"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">New video by Ben Lidgey</strong><br>Flossing in the air photos.app.goo.gl</a><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rNb8YzEVbJPhoVr27" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="a2fc26a008bffbbbc5cee99b3d0560f6" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*dJ_kIgtGGs_ncBgi" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*dJ_kIgtGGs_ncBgi);"></a></div><p name="eda3" id="eda3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed graf--trailing">To finish on a high it is half-term next week, so I have some time off, get to miss the “box ticking” of Halloween, and get to spend some quality time with my family.</p></div></div></section>
