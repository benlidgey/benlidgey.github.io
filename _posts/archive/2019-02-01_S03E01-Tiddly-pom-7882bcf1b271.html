I experienced many changes moving from a large Civil Service organisation to a small software house.</p><h3 name="0143" id="0143" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Things from this week</h3><p name="24ca" id="24ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">My last role had teams that were co-located in the same building, on the same floor. The new place has distributed teams. The ways of working are different, with pros and cons for each of them.</p><p name="abe4" id="abe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My commute has changed from 30+ minutes by car to 10 minutes by Brompton. It has been great to get in the fresh air and cycle to and from work quickly and easily. Admittedly today I drove as I didn’t feel the 16 inch tyres would be that great in the snow and ice. I haven’t tried my Brompton on the smart turbo trainer — I suspect the quick release clamp won’t work. It would be crazy though.</p><p name="ca25" id="ca25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have set up my subscription to <a href="https://rouvy.com/en/" data-href="https://rouvy.com/en/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rouvy </a>for the smart turbo trainer, and celebrated last night by riding for 24km in Iceland. I wanted to do the course in under 45 minutes and was gutted to finish in 45:08. Something to aim for next time, and it could be a useful benchmark to see how my training is going.</p><p name="fecc" id="fecc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It snowed. The country went bonkers. We had soggy snow that didn’t really stay for long, so no great dramas.</p><figure name="dc59" id="dc59" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*OmsLeqKkgCcO-AtqnPXd1A.jpeg" data-width="777" data-height="1600" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OmsLeqKkgCcO-AtqnPXd1A.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="1476" id="1476" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Things for next week</h3><p name="48f7" id="48f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There is a Cardiff Social Cycling ride organised for Sunday riding from Newport Rd to Tredegar House and back. Hopefully it will happen if the snow and ice has gone by then.</p><p name="84aa" id="84aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Try out the “weekly-5 and daily-3 tasks” approach from the “<a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-simple-yet-powerful-weekly-planning-routine-puts-you-in-control-b125baf506b1" data-href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-simple-yet-powerful-weekly-planning-routine-puts-you-in-control-b125baf506b1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This Simple Yet Powerful Weekly Planning Routine Puts You in Control</a>” article. I am still debating between Todoist and Trello for managing my tasks. At the moment Todoist is winning as it is easier to separate tasks into distinct projects or areas and to manage deadlines. I’ve been using labels to plan the weekly and daily tasks.</p><p name="d1a5" id="d1a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next week’s main focus I think is on organising and planning work into releases and more disciplined sprints. The challenge will be as a small team we need to field support calls that come in, and potentially disrupt the planned sprint. There are a number of ways we can work with this such as reserving some time for support calls (a bit like the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/" data-href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google SRE error budgets</a>), prioritising the support calls and adding them to the current sprint or planning in future sprints, or just winging it. I don’t like option 3. We also need to look at how estimation (and therefore forecasting) can be improved.</p><p name="6fb6" id="6fb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are recruiting for new developers, especially those with JavaScript/node/react/react native skills. Drop me a line if you are interested.</p><h3 name="a135" id="a135" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Things I learned</h3><p name="8efa" id="8efa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Remote working teams can function well when everyone embraces the idea. The new place is geared up for that with all the right kit supplied. As a visual person the one thing that I miss at the moment is the ability to go to a whiteboard and draw stuff out. There must be online versions of that, but I have yet to look for them.</p><p name="c2c5" id="c2c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I enjoyed <a href="https://medium.com/u/fb7acededafd" data-href="https://medium.com/u/fb7acededafd" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="fb7acededafd" data-action-value="fb7acededafd" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Ross Maude</a> article on <a href="https://medium.com/@ross_23375/how-i-work-e02b9f7a4256" data-href="https://medium.com/@ross_23375/how-i-work-e02b9f7a4256" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">how he works</a>. The quick cable tidy bag is a good idea and one I might copy, and the noise cancelling headphones look nice. Not sure I can justify the cost to myself at the moment — lots of my time at work is spent on remote calls to the team. I will try out the “weekly-5 and daily-3” planning though.</p><p name="09a5" id="09a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The new office is small (the kitchen area is in the office for example). Having said that it is much quieter than the old open-plan office. There have been a few articles on a regular basis saying open-plan offices don’t work as they are too noisy and mean people cannot concentrate or put on headphones to shut out the noise, thereby undoing the benefits of being able to talk to people easily. A case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unintended consequences</a> perhaps.</p><p name="06ca" id="06ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Large organisations, by necessity, need to be organised. New starters are given lists of things to do, check, learn. There are lots of processes in place, many of which make sense and apply everywhere (like emergency evacuations) but need to be handled on a different scale to smaller places. It is a case of looking at the “user needs” and doing what is needed and appropriate for the size of the organisation. For example the new place requires more team work in that anyone needs to answer the door to sign for a parcel, or to do something. That leads to a more “grown up” mindset as there is no way someone can say “that’s not my job”. It works here, in a large organisation it wouldn’t.</p></div></div></section>
