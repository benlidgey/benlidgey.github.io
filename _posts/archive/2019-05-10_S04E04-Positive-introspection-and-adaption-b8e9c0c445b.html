Last Sunday I did 1h30m on the turbo trainer on the <a href="https://my.rouvy.com/virtual-routes/detail/19357" data-href="https://my.rouvy.com/virtual-routes/detail/19357" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trail Ridge Road</a> which was hard work. The whole ride (which I need to finish to level-up) is about 3 hours. I stopped halfway through as in the afternoon we went on a walk to Ruperra Castle. It was 3 miles but was harder work that we thought as there were some steep climbs. Some lovely bluebell woods, and a very dirty dog.</p><figure name="387d" id="387d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yE2gNWPDEQoqIoTfJYQLAA.jpeg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yE2gNWPDEQoqIoTfJYQLAA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Bluebells in Ruperra forest</figcaption></figure><figure name="4ccb" id="4ccb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Ywqs5BZ9wrcn_CMd8m68Xw.jpeg" data-width="1611" data-height="1342" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ywqs5BZ9wrcn_CMd8m68Xw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Fwwwbbrr fwwwbbbr</figcaption></figure><p name="a56e" id="a56e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Then on the Monday we tried to go cycling in Margam Park, but arrived there to find a “how to train your dragon” family day going on. Instead of paying £30 to go in, we went to the woods above Castell Coch instead. I hadn’t been mountain biking for ages, and doing it on my hybrid was a bit wobbly, but good fun.</p><h4 name="4004" id="4004" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Introspection and imposters</h4><p name="a20d" id="a20d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I read this article “<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450297531/Success-is-a-driver-of-imposter-syndrome" data-href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450297531/Success-is-a-driver-of-imposter-syndrome" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Success is a driver of imposter syndrome</a>” this week and it reminded me of a time in a previous job where my ability and skills were questioned by other to the extent that I ended up questioning my own abilities. I went through a long period of introspection and (thankfully) came out realising my own strengths and skills. This ultimately made me stronger and more confident. It also made me more aware of the default behaviours I need to be aware of, and how to change my behaviour in certain situations. For example, one of my traits is that I have a dry, sarcastic sense of humour which may not be appropriate in certain circumstances. So, when I feel I am about to say something I regard as funny I double check if it the others I am with would feel the same, or if it may be mis-construed.</p><p name="37e7" id="37e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I realise it is important to celebrate successes (no matter how trivial it may seem) with the team, but to also recognise and celebrate my own successes. This week I have achieved some hard rides on the turbo trainer, completed some definite DIY tasks and had good conversations with colleagues on how to improve the way we work, and have learned things as part of it.</p><h4 name="cdc2" id="cdc2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Daily scrums and status meetings</h4><p name="8b63" id="8b63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Yesterday one of the team challenged the purpose of one of the daily scrums. The conversations often go on longer than perhaps they should, and are not always relevant to all of the team. We then had a good debate about the point of a daily scrum, and the difference between what it aims to achieve and a “status meeting”. The <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily" data-href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scrum Guide</a> describes it as:</p><blockquote name="00c0" id="00c0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog.</blockquote><p name="c8a6" id="c8a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We tended to treat it as a status meeting, with people going through what they are working on, rather than focussing on what needs to be done to meet the sprint goal. <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-myths-daily-scrum-not-status-meeting" data-href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-myths-daily-scrum-not-status-meeting" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scrum Myths: Daily Scrum Is Not a Status Meeting</a> is an interesting article on the differences, and again highlights the focus on transparency, collaboration and outcomes.</p><p name="5862" id="5862" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are other reasons that I think contribute to the length of the daily scrum, including the large team size and that there are several different streams of work happening in the same team/sprint. This suggests the need to split the work and team into the different streams and different daily scrums. The work is probably not that simple to split, but it is a good discussion to have in the next retro and to experiment.</p><h4 name="20f2" id="20f2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Debates without empirical evidence</h4><p name="bcd5" id="bcd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Another debate this week is the relative priority of delivering user stories and delivering technical improvements. This kicks off the debate about the impact on delivering user stories if people work on technical improvements — technical improvement work may delay the completion of user stories, while technical improvements may improve the quality and speed at which user stories can be delivered. Without decent measurements on velocity, metrics like test coverage and rework it still remains a bit of guesswork.</p><h4 name="51f6" id="51f6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">To build or deploy, that is the question</h4><p name="6859" id="6859" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The final debate this week has been on the build process, and the overloaded use of “build” to mean the building of some code and the deployment of some code to an environment (where sometimes a new build needs to be made for a new environment).</p><p name="cd43" id="cd43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A build is when a known state of code is built using a known set of tools. This typically means the code is from a known bracnch and tagged. The code is then built once using Jenkins and the built artifacts stored somewhere like Artifactory or Docker Registry. Builds include information on the release version, build number, changes (commits or Jira) included in the build.</p><p name="002d" id="002d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A deployment is then when a known build is deployed onto an environment with config for that environment. The config should also be stored and managed in source control — that way we can tag the config for that deployment allowing us to know which code and config were running on an environment.</p><p name="2c1a" id="2c1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We don’t need to move all builds along the deployment pipeline — so build 123-abc that was deployed to the test server does not have to go to pre-production automatically as that may be an interim build for QA. If we decide to deploy build 123-abc with the pre-production config to the pre-production server then the build would remain at 123-abc.</p><p name="bc90" id="bc90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We should not rebuild code for different environments; that means the rebuilt code has not been tested on previous environments.</p><h3 name="d535" id="d535" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Next week</h3><p name="0c8f" id="0c8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Who knows what next week will bring. We are thinking of going to the<a href="https://www.visitcardiff.com/event/car-free-day/" data-href="https://www.visitcardiff.com/event/car-free-day/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Car Free day on Sunday</a> as that was fun last year and we got some good freebies! Someone pointed out last year that the air smelled so much cleaner, and I keep thinking about that now when I am cycling or walking and a smelly bus or car drives past.</p><p name="a9e9" id="a9e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">At work we might re-arrange the office to move the Wifi router to somewhere more central, and to allow ethernet cables to be run to the switch.</p></div></div></section>
