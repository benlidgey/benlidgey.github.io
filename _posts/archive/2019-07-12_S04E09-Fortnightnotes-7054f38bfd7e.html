I have also been looking at what it would take to stay in the current office by getting decent internet connections and an office refurb. It has all made me think of the user needs for an office, which is something I have not really done before. It has made me think about the needs of the individuals (desks, number of power and data sockets, chairs, lighting, breakout areas, kitchens, showers, storage) and the team (collaboration, sitting together, whiteboards, needs for different types of meetings and the rooms to support that, from conference calls, group design, private meetings, impromtu ones) and other things like hot-desking, H&amp;S.</p><figure name="1977" id="1977" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oqX7N4UBSC6LQRii0dFtCA.jpeg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oqX7N4UBSC6LQRii0dFtCA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Every office needs a secret lab</figcaption></figure><p name="2d8a" id="2d8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I also happened to read these excellent articles on hotel room user needs which made me chuckle: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-hotel-rooms-11-anti-patterns-sharon-o-dea/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-hotel-rooms-11-anti-patterns-sharon-o-dea/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-hotel-rooms-11-anti-patterns-sharon-o-dea/</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-hotel-rooms-part-2-11-more-design-crimes-sharon-o-dea/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-hotel-rooms-part-2-11-more-design-crimes-sharon-o-dea/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-hotel-rooms-part-2-11-more-design-crimes-sharon-o-dea/</a>.</p><h4 name="33a6" id="33a6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Scrum/Scrumban/Kanban</h4><p name="0b7a" id="0b7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">At work we use Scrum, and as a small team also have to respond to live issues and support requests. This means our sprints often get scope change as issues are received that need quick attention and turnaround. A recent example is that the sprint started with a commitment of 35 items, the team completed 45, but another 32 were taken on in the sprint, so we didn’t make as much of a big impact on the backlog as we wanted.</p><p name="8f73" id="8f73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are all sorts of things that we can investigate and improve on (prioritisation of work, committing to fewer items, removing items from the sprint when new issues are added). It raised the question of “is Scrum the right thing for us?” and “Should we move to Kanban?”. There are plenty of sites that talk about Scrum and Kanban and refer to ScrumBan as the transition path. It seems a sensible approach to help people understand the Kanban and Lean principles and keeping the Scrum ceremonies to ease the rate of change.</p><h4 name="825e" id="825e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">I am a not a number, I am a platform version</h4><p name="21c3" id="21c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We had a discussion about versioning: do we give a single version for the whole platform (made up of a group of services), or version each one independently.</p><p name="b698" id="b698" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are pros and cons to each approach:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="3452" id="3452" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Versioning t he whole platform means it is easier to communicate to the ustomer, but harder to track what is in a particular version especially as the code is in different repos. Support is harder for the same reasons. Builds and releases mean versioning everything the same.</li><li name="13d2" id="13d2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Versioning each service means you can release services independently. You would need to keep a manifest of whcih versions of each service are on the platform. Support can refer to particular versions of the software, and if a service maps to a single (or small group) repo it is easier to identify the changes in a service version.</li></ol><p name="a8fa" id="a8fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The whole thing is also muddled, or maybe helped, by the builds baking docker images. A docker image can be versioned, and include known versions of services.</p><h4 name="b81d" id="b81d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Continual improvement and a focus on quality</h4><p name="e725" id="e725" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As we continue to develop the platform, I want to encourage people to take a culture of thinking about more practices when developing. For example, unit testing, security pricniples, scalability, accessibility are all areas that need to be thought about and done by default when making changes.</p><p name="96ce" id="96ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is the (unfortunaltely common) challenge of doing “just enough” to get the changes delivered, with the perceived short term gain but the longer term drag on productivity as the bog of technical debt sucks productivity and quality down.</p><h4 name="70e9" id="70e9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Paintballing hurts</h4><p name="4a6d" id="4a6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Last Sunday I went paintballing iwht my son’s U13 football team. The weather got hotter and hotter as the day wore on. Some of the levels at Delta Force were good fun, especually when they had a goal (capture the flag, grab the zombie head), and some just seemed too hard to really bother with. Especially in the hard/boring levels I had a few times when I thought “sod it, I am just going to run for it” and ended up getting shot multiple times. Paint balls hurt and leave bruises! The thing that hurt the most though, was finding the next day I could hardly walk as my leg muscles were not used to me running about croutching over.</p><figure name="799e" id="799e" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p graf--trailing"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Nh0ZXPkEN9sWY/twitter/iframe" width="435" height="435" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure></div></div></section>
