It is a magnificant place to go — wild, remote (yet accessible), and full of wildlife and beautiful scenary. The main thing I like about it is the “back to basics” of it. There are no clocks in the cottage, no TV, no wifi or mobile access and that really encourages me to spend quality time with my family without any distractions of emails, social media and other stuff. At the start of the week I got frustrated with the inability to get an instant weather forecast, but soon found other ways to get it; the pub has it on the noticeboard, or I could just look at the sky above, and the sky over the Atlantic/Bristol channel. If the clouds were dark and grey it might rain if the wind is blowing them this way. We all enjoyed being out and about enjoying the island and spending quality time together. This is what life it really about.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="9ce5" id="9ce5" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_sP3pLVfEQrRqVqitoffvg.jpeg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*_sP3pLVfEQrRqVqitoffvg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Old Light in clear weather</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="b5a5" id="b5a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I especially like the way the “Old Light” lighthouse was built on the highest part of the island before the builders realised that was the first place the fog and mist descended, making the lighthouse invisible and therefore useless. So they built a gun battery to fire blanks from cannons when the fog came in. However ships thought they were being fired on and scattered, meaning that approach also didn’t work very well. Eventually they had to build 2 lighthouses — one at each end of the island — and they are still operational about 100 years later. A good example of iterative design based on user feedback.</p><figure name="bec5" id="bec5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*h6ydL8JBGy3OjqlyZbAToQ.png" data-width="360" data-height="640" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*h6ydL8JBGy3OjqlyZbAToQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Old Light in drizzle</figcaption></figure><p name="5736" id="5736" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This week I came back to work to a heap of emails, many of which were of no use or interest. It made me think of the purpose of emails, and if email has lost its “mojo”. Many people sing the praises of various messaging platforms, like Slack, as better ways to communicate with each other. However, that can up the tempo as people expect a quicker response than emails. Distractions are easily made as the notification icons blink/flash/wink/hoot to get your attention. Surely if something is that important people can talk to each other?</p><p name="f0e0" id="f0e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As teams we should all go “off grid” to get something done and actually talk to each other.</p><figure name="fe93" id="fe93" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*l0uaTsAR0HFGdqwW_26aMQ.jpeg" data-width="2160" data-height="3840" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l0uaTsAR0HFGdqwW_26aMQ.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
