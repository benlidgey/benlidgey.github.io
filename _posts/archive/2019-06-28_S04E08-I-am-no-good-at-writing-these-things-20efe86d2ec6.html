It started by a <a href="https://twitter.com/benlidgey/status/1140954434287149056" data-href="https://twitter.com/benlidgey/status/1140954434287149056" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a> asking people to post their thoughts on different types of workplace bullying. I also saw <a href="https://twitter.com/benlister74/status/1141714457778892801" data-href="https://twitter.com/benlister74/status/1141714457778892801" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this tweet</a> from and actually watched the <a href="https://t.co/JDLudykihP?amp=1" data-href="https://t.co/JDLudykihP?amp=1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video </a>(yes, I can actually do something from my todo list!)</p><p name="679d" id="679d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Last weekend I went mountain biking with my son again at Afan Argoed. This time I rented a full suss (my first time on one). I struggled with the adjustable seat post at first, but then soon got into the ride. The weather was awful this time — it started raining just after we had set off, and got worse. It made the ride different rather than horrid.</p><figure name="40d6" id="40d6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gbQhUDmeybfaVW4EUjokkw.png" data-width="491" data-height="320" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gbQhUDmeybfaVW4EUjokkw.png"></figure><p name="3b68" id="3b68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We decided to ride the Penhydd red route, having done the Blue Scar blue route the last time. We somehow got caught up with a large group which made us a bit nervous about holding them up on the singletrack. We did ride slower than some people but they were all fine about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3UCYOxSYWVE" data-href="https://youtu.be/3UCYOxSYWVE" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sidewinder </a>was surreal — riding from the heavy rain into the shelter of the forest trees with a dim light filtering through the trees like a scene from the Stranger Things upside down.</p><figure name="c389" id="c389" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UCYOxSYWVE" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="6520" id="6520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">My confidence took another knock (and parts of my physically did too) as I fell off a few times, and struggled with some large rocky drop offs on Resolution. Overall though it was good fun, and we intend to go back soon, and maybe do some Blue Scar routes and some of the less technical Penhydd routes.</p><h4 name="e2ef" id="e2ef" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Are you ready? Are you done?</h4><p name="98c2" id="98c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This week I completed a draft “definition of ready” and “definition of done” for the teams to review and comment. The main point is to get the conversations flowing about what each story means to achieve, to get people thinking about the user needs, and ultimately to help to bring the dev and QA teams closer together.</p><h4 name="de4a" id="de4a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Discovery</h4><p name="3798" id="3798" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">I was introduced by <a href="https://medium.com/u/580b65df502c" data-href="https://medium.com/u/580b65df502c" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="580b65df502c" data-action-value="580b65df502c" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Ian Ames</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@stuartmccoll/weeknotes-21-06-19-2f2d01b4631a" data-href="https://medium.com/@stuartmccoll/weeknotes-21-06-19-2f2d01b4631a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">this </a>week note by <a href="http://twitter.com/stuartmccoll" data-href="http://twitter.com/stuartmccoll" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Twitter profile for @stuartmccoll" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@stuartmccoll</a> which was a very well written one. It triggered a thought in my head about the difference and similarities between project phases for small and large organisations. Having left a Civil Service organisation which followed the GDS phases (discovery, alpha, beta, live) and moved to a very small company I realised that the small company still needs to do the same things as the GDS phases but without necessarily calling them by names. For example we need to discuss some new work with the client to get an idea of what they are looking to achieve, and give them a high level estimate of how long and how much it will be (discovery anyone?). Then sometimes we create wireframes to drill into the concepts more (alpha) and the beta phases show up as regular releases being shown to the client to get quick feedback.</p></div></div></section>
