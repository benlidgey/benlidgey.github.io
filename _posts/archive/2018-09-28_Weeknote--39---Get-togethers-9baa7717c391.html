The tools looked very whizzy but I was not convinced they offered much value above what can be done already with business rules. The “bots” looked to be doing keyword matching and navigating down a defined rule tree. It is probably worth looking into some more, and implementing a few proof of concept apps.</p><figure name="a12d" id="a12d" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*3lEoHif262iGFZF0" data-width="3968" data-height="2976" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3lEoHif262iGFZF0"><figcaption class="imageCaption">“blue and black robot figurine” by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@contrastband?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@contrastband?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Craig Sybert</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4 name="c871" id="c871" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Frustrated Transformers</h4><p name="0c88" id="0c88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Tuesday I went to the “Transforming Together” event for Civil Service people at the Millennium Stadium ( I still struggle to remember that it has changed its name). This was a really good event looking at various challenges for how we can link up between departments, find out who is working on similar things and so on. As a very large organisation it is not a simple problem to solve, and because of that there were not really any tangible actions that came from it. There was a definite vibe in the groups I was in that the Civil Service is still very London-centric, even down to referring to other parts of the country, like Wales, as “the regions”.</p><p name="a16e" id="a16e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A good phrase that came out of the day was that of a “frustrated transformer” who is someone who wants to make things better but feels they are hampered by process, people or something else. I think I am one of them. If frustrated transformers continue to be frustrated then their ideas and efforts will be lost.</p><h4 name="fac8" id="fac8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Blockchain hype or useful?</h4><p name="5f10" id="5f10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">On Wednesday I went to London to Blockchain Live in the Kensington Olympia. For an events venue it is difficult to get to. Once there I spent most of the day in the GovTech room listening to different people and organisations talking about how they have used, or are looking at using, blockchain for various problems. HMRC have been looking at how blockchain could help to simplify the import/export paperwork trails which was interesting. The Government of Jersey talked less about blockchain but about how it is difficult to verify identity of overseas banking customers, and how tools like blockchain can turn the process upside down: instead of the customer providing details to the bank for the bank to then verify, the customer provides verifiable or authenticated identity information to the bank. A common theme through many talks was how policy is behind tech, but that shouldn’t stop the tech being looked at. One solution though that puzzled me was the University of Nicosia who issue degree certificates signed on a blockchain. These certificates can then be sent to an employer who can verify it on the University website. Why does this need blockchain; surely a private/public key signature could also work?</p><p name="a3e1" id="a3e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The train journey home was slow. I can’t understand why GWR have bought new trains that are half the size of the old ones, and so they need to link two trains together to keep the capacity.</p><h4 name="6cd7" id="6cd7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Back to normality</h4><p name="7949" id="7949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Thursday and Friday were back at the office, looking at the ways we can organise teams, and some planning and forecasting for the work we need to do. I had a lovely, spur of the moment pub dinner with my wife yesterday. And today I cycled into work which was nice and refreshing.</p><h4 name="e60f" id="e60f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Threes</h4><p name="b657" id="b657" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A few weeks ago I tried the 3s: what 3 things was I looking forward to, what 3 things have I achieved and what 3 things would I look to change. Here is another attempt.</p><p name="f9c4" id="f9c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week I had a positive day on Tuesday at Transforming Together that was much more positive than I was expecting. I collected by daughters bike from being serviced. I made a good first draft of the resource plans and forecasts for the DevOps roadmap.</p><p name="ff5c" id="ff5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would change the GWR train journey as it was long and slow. The GWR train staff though were super in their professional and happy outlook despite being on a hot and sweaty train that was packed with people. This is too large for me to change though. For 3 micro-actions I would make sure I drink enough water, read one Medium article or watch one TED talk a day, and cycle or run at least twice a week.</p><p name="f8e7" id="f8e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Looking forward to going on a bike ride with my daughter on her newly-serviced bike. Catching up with my childhood buddy who is coming over this weekend. Also looking forward to having a normal week without travelling all over the place.</p></div></div></section>
