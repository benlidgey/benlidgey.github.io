As it is a long journey I looked at getting the train instead, but for 2 of us it would cost approx £150. Driving would take about the same time and cost maybe £50 in fuel. A bit of a no brainer cost-wise, but a shame from a personal point as it is more relaxing on the train, and from an environmental angle too.</p><figure name="ed47" id="ed47" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*NFuQqlgwZZcO8yTR" data-width="5184" data-height="3456" data-unsplash-photo-id="0Kw44ElHN3A" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*NFuQqlgwZZcO8yTR"><figcaption class="imageCaption">A nice metaphor for planning too.

Often these sprint goals contain 2 points, as there are multiple work streams happening in parallel. We could look to organise the work into single streams, but the client requirements mean we need to do both, and we have people in the teams with skills for the different workstreams. So we created 2 views of teh same board, one for each workstream, and that seems to work.</p><p name="27be" id="27be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week has also been busy because it is sprint change over week. Again the challenge is to make time for the demos, retros and planning. The sessions are not as long as I would ideally want, but they seem to work for now. I did wonder whether we should lengthen the sprints from 2 weeks to 4 weeks, but then we would need longer sprint ceremonies to compensate. It is still complicated by remote teams.</p><p name="4f30" id="4f30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ideally we need to move to Kanban to allow for live issues to be worked on too (they currently are brought into the sprint if deemed high enough priority), so I also wondered about shortening the sprints to 1 week.</p><p name="57c5" id="57c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Finally this week I have been looking at offices again, getting quotes for broadband connections and fit outs. I am always surprised how the central offices have crap network connections. It seems easier to get broadband at home than it is as a business.</p></div></div></section>
