There are loads of articles about forming a habit (like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/creating-a-new-habit-comes-down-to-four-factors-1741119950" data-href="https://lifehacker.com/creating-a-new-habit-comes-down-to-four-factors-1741119950" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this </a>one) that talk about doing something simple and regularly (21 times before it sticks?). I think some of that has subconsciously put me off. As someone who favours structure and detail I immediately jump into thinking about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how</em> I can start the habit and not just getting on with it. My mind clouds with thoughts of repeating tasks in a task manager, is there an app to track if I am doing is consistently (other than the task manager), and thoughts about what makes a good weeknote.</p><p name="7478" id="7478" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now I realise, who cares? The real benefits I can see for me for writing weeknotes is to help me reflect on what I have achieved and thereby improving my positivity, learning from both positive and not-so-positive experiences and thinking about what is coming up next. If no-one reads them then those benefits still exist, if some people read them and get something that helps them, then that is an added bonus. So I will start writing weeknotes from tomorrow, and see how it goes. In true agile fashion I will review the benefits and value they are delivering, probably tweak the format, but most importantly have a go.</p><p name="79a5" id="79a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Watch this space.</p></div></div></section>
