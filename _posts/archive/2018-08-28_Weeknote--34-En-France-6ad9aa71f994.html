The weather was really nice, the area was very relaxing and we saw some amazing places.</p><p name="82a7" id="82a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had no idea that there were so many Brits in the area. We kept hearing British voices in the markets and cafes, and saw lots of British number plates on cars. And then I learned that the area was occupied a lot by the English (British?) in the Hundred Years’ War, and is now occupied, in a friendly way, by Brits again.</p><p name="f1f1" id="f1f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chateau de Beynac is an amazing castle on the cliffs overlooking the Dordogne river, and somewhere Richard Lionheart stayed for a while. The engineering to make a castle on somewhere that high and precarious is inspirational.</p><figure name="887d" id="887d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KED-9oL6Yb-ZKth6o1ld0w.jpeg" data-width="512" data-height="384" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KED-9oL6Yb-ZKth6o1ld0w.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Beynac" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Beynac" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Beynac</a></figcaption></figure><p name="d8b1" id="d8b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Another amazing place is <a href="https://www.northofthedordogne.com/laroquegageac.php" data-href="https://www.northofthedordogne.com/laroquegageac.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">La Roque Gageac</a>, just down the road, which shows the determination of people to build a village on such a narrow strip of land between the cliffs and the river, and to use the cliffs as part of the infrastructure.</p><figure name="ceed" id="ceed" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*MWhM2ByKVTJ8abpqsF_pxA.jpeg" data-width="480" data-height="320" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MWhM2ByKVTJ8abpqsF_pxA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.northofthedordogne.com/laroquegageac.php" data-href="https://www.northofthedordogne.com/laroquegageac.php" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.northofthedordogne.com/laroquegageac.php</a></figcaption></figure><p name="aafb" id="aafb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A few things that struck us last week about the French way of doings things:</p><p name="0721" id="0721" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sense of community is very strong. This was most apparent in an evening market in Villereal where local farmers and businesses would sell their wares, including freshly made food. People turned up fully prepared with tablecloths, proper crockery and cutlery and wine glasses, and sat down in the town square to have a relaxing evening sampling the local produce.</p><p name="42a3" id="42a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Health and safety is more relaxed. In markets such as the one in Villereal, if a stall needed an electric cable they would just run an extension lead over to their stall. If it crossed a pavement it wouldn’t be taped down or covered in some rubber cover, people would just be sensible and step over it. We did have a debate about whether that was a good thing (and the H&amp;S rules in the UK were OTT), or not.</p><p name="d742" id="d742" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Food is real — vegetables are different shapes and sizes, often covered in mud from the fields, and tasted lovely. You would expect that in farmers’ markets but the local Intermarche supermarket was the same. In the UK supermarkets have strict rules on shape, size, colour that food should meet, and are now some are making a “thing” about promoting <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">wonky veg</em> as if it is a good thing. All veg is wonky, so surely that should be the norm, with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">strict veg</em> being the odd one out.</p></div></div></section>
