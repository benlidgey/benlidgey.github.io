When I arrived as the garage opened I was told there were 4 cars in front of mine, and it would be “a 30 minute wait”. So I went and had a coffee (and cheeky bacon roll) and went back 30 minutes later to find that nothing had happened. I then waited for another 40 minutes before someone called to say there was a nail in my tyre (yes I know, I told you that when I arrived). So after 1 hour 10 minutes I was still waiting. The car tyre was finally finished another 30 minutes later. So in total I spent 100 minutes for the tyre to be fixed, after expecting to be waiting for 30 minutes. It wasn’t what I would call a quick fit.</p><figure name="5529" id="5529" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*rw0_tgpeVw9d4tpb" data-width="3088" data-height="2056" data-unsplash-photo-id="IQsgtHLbtdI" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rw0_tgpeVw9d4tpb"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jlhopes?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@jlhopes?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">David Edelstein</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="173b" id="173b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Being the geek that I am I thought: “why don’t they use lead time and cycle time measurements to give customers a better idea of the waiting time”. Surely they must use things like job sheets to record the work, the person doing the work, stock used and the overall cost. While I was sat in the waiting room I started to think over it.</p><p name="5531" id="5531" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following definitions come from <a href="https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/lean-flow-metrics/" data-href="https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/lean-flow-metrics/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/lean-flow-metrics/</a></p><h4 name="9eb9" id="9eb9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Lead time</h4><blockquote name="8db9" id="8db9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">Lead time measures the total time it takes for work to move through the value stream, from the moment the work is requested to the time it’s delivered. Lead time measures duration from beginning to end. This includes process time, as well as time that work spends sitting in queues, or wait states.</blockquote><p name="6771" id="6771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In my case lead time would be the time from when I arrived at the garage to the time I left with the fixed tyre. So 100 minutes.</p><h4 name="a67a" id="a67a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Cycle time</h4><blockquote name="faa3" id="faa3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">Cycle time measures how long it takes a work item to get from point A to point B.</blockquote><p name="e8b6" id="e8b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In my case the cycle time was 30 minutes.</p><h4 name="b802" id="b802" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Getting a grip</h4><p name="fb65" id="fb65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So if the garage measured the typical cycle time for different types of jobs they can then use it to inform new customers arriving what the overall time would be (the lead time).</p><p name="9d33" id="9d33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, take the following times (made up by me):</p><ul class="postList"><li name="d21c" id="d21c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Initial investigation: 10 minutes</li><li name="6587" id="6587" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Changing an old tyre for a new one takes 25 minutes</li><li name="0522" id="0522" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fixing a puncture takes 30 minutes</li><li name="9a85" id="9a85" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fixing a car’s tracking takes 10 minutes</li></ul><p name="f1b2" id="f1b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">My car will take 40 minutes to be fixed (10 minutes investigation and 30 minutes to fix the puncture).</p><p name="7c5e" id="7c5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I arrived there were 4 cars in front of me, and 4 cars can be processed at once (there are 4 ramps in the garage).</p><h4 name="5ae7" id="5ae7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Best case for me</h4><p name="2cef" id="2cef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The best case for me would be that each of the 4 cars only needed tracking doing. This is an unlikely scenario I accept. In this case I would need to wait:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="a551" id="a551" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">10 minutes investigation</li><li name="55e2" id="55e2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">10 minutes tracking</li></ul><p name="f9e9" id="f9e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">making a total of 20 minutes before my car can be looked at and another 40 minutes for my car to be fixed: total lead time of 60 minutes.</p><h4 name="8fa0" id="8fa0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Worst case for me</h4><p name="b18f" id="b18f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The worst case for me is that all 4 cars in front need 4 tyres changing and tracking done:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="fc6a" id="fc6a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">10 minutes investigation</li><li name="b0a5" id="b0a5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">25 minutes per tyre (4 tyres) = 100 minutes</li><li name="fb9f" id="fb9f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">10 minutes tracking</li></ul><p name="0c3f" id="0c3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">making a total of 120 minutes. At which point my car can be looked at: total lead time of 160 minutes.</p><h3 name="5173" id="5173" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">So how can this lead to improvements?</h3><p name="d263" id="d263" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When work starts on a car the garage would look at everything that needs to be done. This information can be entered into the system, or calculated as part of the job definition.</p><p name="6dde" id="6dde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The system can then show the estimated lead times for the current jobs. When new customers arrive they can estimate what needs to be done based on discussions with the new customer and add that to the list of jobs. This will give an ongoing, changing view of the lead times and cycle times.</p><p name="3c86" id="3c86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The critical part is constantly measuring and updating the lead and cycle times. This can be done across all the garages to give the largest sample size. There will always be jobs with unexpected findings, and using techniques like cumulative flow and control charts these outliers can be identified, investigated and included or excluded.</p><p name="7b1a" id="7b1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Surely this would be beneficial to customers and the company?</p></div></div></section>
