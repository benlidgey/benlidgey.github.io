There are a number of areas we are looking to improve on, and AI is sometimes touted as the “thing” that will make improvements. I feel that the problems that need solving haven’t been identified and that reaching for a buzzword like “AI” is solutioneering. Hopefully the programme will have shown there are many types of AI, and that there are also challenges when using one or more of them, especially around the areas where the learning cannot be understood. Sometimes a simpler solution, such as rule-based engines, can be just as effective.</p><figure name="df8b" id="df8b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*kDvqlFAc1rgbZr8-_ukgFQ.png" data-width="1510" data-height="1262" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kDvqlFAc1rgbZr8-_ukgFQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">BBC The Joy of AI with Professor Jim Al-Khalili on iPlayer</figcaption></figure><p name="7665" id="7665" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Most days this week I had things I wanted to do at home or work, and got constantly slowed down or prevented. For example on Tuesday I went to B&amp;Q to get some shelving to finish the wardrobe at home. However, all the other sizes of shelving were in stock, except the one I wanted. So I went home unable to continue with that work. I did eventually order them and collect them on Thursday when they were back in stock. Incidentally, the B&amp;Q Click and Collect service is great, especially when ordering bulky items.</p><p name="f9d9" id="f9d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Thursday I facilitated a series of Lightning talks at work from the Corporate Leadership Group. It was interesting to see how some presenters were a bit flustered at the slides appearing to advance too quickly, or not quickly enough, but that just added to the atmosphere (in a good way). The talks were organised so that some from the Corporate Leadership Group can tell people about themselves as people, and not as “managers”. The fact that there was some nerves and flustering helped to show that this wasn’t a corporate, polished set of presentations. We finished with a quick fire quiz running off a set of slides also auto-advancing in Lightning Talk style.</p><figure name="c765" id="c765" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*u5IGUvYTFvjOt6gm_RSzNw.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1279" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*u5IGUvYTFvjOt6gm_RSzNw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/barn-lightning-bolt-storm-1364280/" data-href="https://pixabay.com/en/barn-lightning-bolt-storm-1364280/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://pixabay.com/en/barn-lightning-bolt-storm-1364280/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="daaa" id="daaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">And now as I look forward to the weekend, I am thinking of finishing some of the tasks that I couldn’t get completed (such as those damn shelves), and grateful that the weather is going to be crap and so I won’t be missing any opportunities for having fun outside.</p></div></div></section>
