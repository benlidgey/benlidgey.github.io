I had never really heard about the Stoics, and only thought of stoicism as a trait rather than a following or a way of life. A lot of what Derren talked about was starting to ring bells in my head. Approaches like only focus on the things you have control of, and do not get stressed or worried about things you cannot control. The philosophy around Stoicism interested me, and is something I would like to look into further.</p><figure name="8a49" id="8a49" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JV2Os2ltTnoAjJ6B7qcbBg.jpeg" data-width="321" data-height="480" data-is-featured="true" alt="Keep calm and carry on poster" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JV2Os2ltTnoAjJ6B7qcbBg.jpeg"></figure><p name="f0c9" id="f0c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">At different points in my life I have had dips in my personal confidence and confidence in my ability which continue to this day. More recently in one of those dips I read up on the “imposter syndrome” concept where people can think they are not good at what they are doing, they are merely being an imposter and will be found out one day. I realised that it is something that I can feel, and that at times perhaps people have been able to make me feel an imposter.</p><p name="03db" id="03db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the more recent episodes of a dip in my confidence has led me to become stubborn, and almost resistant to feedback. I only tend to accept feedback from people I respect; I shrug off feedback from people I don’t respect, perhaps as a self-defence mechanism. This may mean I miss out on useful feedback, but I am OK with that. Life is meant for living and I don’t have time to listen to people I don’t like.</p><p name="6aaa" id="6aaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stoicism and imposter syndrome seem linked. People experiencing imposter syndrome can feel things are getting out of control and they will be discovered to be fake. Mixing in a dose of focusing on things you can control, will mean you can reduce the imposter feeling — if you cannot control if other people will call you out, then don’t bother worrying about it. You can control how well you do things and how you improve, so focus on that instead.</p><p name="1038" id="1038" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If someone now gives me feedback on something I did and I feel that the decisions I made at the time were right, I can’t go back and change those decisions, so there is no point in replaying that decision point over and over again. Similarly if some feedback or event is identified in a retrospective as something that happened that we could not have foreseen, then I would facilitate a discussion on whether that was caused or created by some actions of the team, or just something that happened. If it is the latter, then we can note it but disregard it.</p><p name="39da" id="39da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is always the option to inspect and adapt, to look at what happened and adapt the way those things were done, and the inputs into the decisions were made, and I always try to continually improve. That should always be done on a strong foundation of celebrating achievements and recognising strengths.</p><p name="9125" id="9125" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more recent events surrounding COVID-19 can also show in people as the good old British “stiff upper lip”, “keep calm and carry on” spirit that is sometimes called out as “stoic”. The stiff upper lip though doesn’t mean ignoring what is going on and pretending nothing is happening. The world is a strange place right now, and we all need to look at what we can control, what we can’t control. We need to make sure we are doing our best to make decisions around what we can control, and to always take opportunities to inspect and adapt, and to recognise and celebrate our own strengths and achievements.</p><p name="bc9c" id="bc9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some links</p><div name="9b91" id="9b91" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/the-great-philosophers-the-stoics/" data-href="https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/the-great-philosophers-the-stoics/" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/the-great-philosophers-the-stoics/"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Stoics</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">&#39;Stoicism&#39; was a philosophy that flourished for some 400 years in Ancient Greece and Rome, gaining widespread support…</em>www.theschooloflife.com</a><a href="https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/the-great-philosophers-the-stoics/" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="2b8a695f5702bc5bb80d63c8577e9880" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*45-GGYTH4JhiNa0e" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*45-GGYTH4JhiNa0e);"></a></div><div name="4e75" id="4e75" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed graf--trailing"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05nbzfh" data-href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05nbzfh" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05nbzfh"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">BBC Radio 4 - My Life as a..., Series 1, Stoic, Derren Brown: &#39;Stoicism articulates things I was…</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">My life as a Stoic</em>www.bbc.co.uk</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05nbzfh" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="47f077796f63f0738cc03d33f1d2f4ed" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*ifEqVE_SOFPAD85a" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*ifEqVE_SOFPAD85a);"></a></div></div></div></section>
