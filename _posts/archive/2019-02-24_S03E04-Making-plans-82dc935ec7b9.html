There were some challenges but on the whole it was a successful week.</p><h3 name="40af" id="40af" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Remote retros</h3><p name="0592" id="0592" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first challenge was how to do a retrospective with teams spread over the world. The first thing to reduce was the number of people sat with headphones on. The people in the Cardiff office met in the meeting room. I was mindful of making sure people not in the room were involved continually, as they will not be able to see the non-verbal comms in the room.</p><p name="cd5f" id="cd5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While there are many different retro styles that can be useful to tease out different themes or areas (such as focussing on success, or on particular areas to improve), as this was the first retro and I am still experimenting with remote teams I stuck to the basic “what went well/what could have been better/things to work on” format. I used screen-sharing in Teams to share a Word document to enter the points people were making. This worked well, and with a few observations:</p><p name="4c67" id="4c67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was no way for people to independently and anonymously make their points like they would be able to with post-its. There is always the “risk” that the louder, more extrovert people would dominate the conversations. One tactic that was tried in the retro for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">delivercon 2018</em> was to use the collaboration options in online office systems like O365 or Google Docs to let everyone enter their points at the same time. I might try this again.</p><p name="54d8" id="54d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Video conferencing can be used to involve others in the meeting. We use O365 and Teams a lot, so with some webcams we could try a simple video conferencing solution.</p><h3 name="51c8" id="51c8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Remote planning</h3><p name="9810" id="9810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Remote planning had the same challenges as the retros, with the addition of not being able to do planning poker. There were some areas that have made estimating difficult at present:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5ed8" id="5ed8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">New teams — there are new people in the teams, with most of the knowledge with some senior people.</li><li name="6c54" id="6c54" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Varied knowledge and experience of agile. Some of the new people have had little experience of agile planning. Some sessions on the advantages and disadvantages of planning using story points, how that feeds into forecasting.</li><li name="a286" id="a286" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A separation of development and QA. The teams have a feeling of a dev/QA split with work being done by dev and then handed over to QA. I think it is partly down to the QA teams being located elsewhere. Perhaps more video conferencing might help to create a feeling of a single team. Planning points that have been done so far have often been dev-led and stories not considered needing to be finished by the whole team.</li></ul><figure name="722a" id="722a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yvzFeRtKd8x3PujmBDQSOg.jpeg" data-width="506" data-height="371" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yvzFeRtKd8x3PujmBDQSOg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/planning-poker" data-href="https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/planning-poker" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/planning-poker</a></figcaption></figure><h3 name="63fa" id="63fa" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Conferences and talks</h3><p name="6d3d" id="6d3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I have been asked to give a talk at the National Software Academy in March which will be interesting.
