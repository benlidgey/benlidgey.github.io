Last week was a busy week of dealing with daily tasks while trying to find time to stop and think.

In order to do that we need to be more organised how we define and manage releases so it is clearer what branch names to create and so forth.</p><h4 name="61ef" id="61ef" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">National Software Academy</h4><p name="f60b" id="f60b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I went to the National Software Academy to talk to the 2nd year students about what to think about when changing Agile and DevOps processes. The students were generally interested, knowledgeable about the principles involved and had some good thoughts when we had some interactive sessions (using the 1–2–4-All method from Liberating Structures, a good way to give people some time to stop and think).</p><p name="7c74" id="7c74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I continue to be impressed with the NSA approach to teaching students the required skills for developing software in a commercial way.</p><p name="470c" id="470c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The actual office space (as it is run in an office-like environment, not lecture theatres) is well equipped with plenty of linked TV screens to show content, radio mics and also a throwable microphone for the workshop sessions.</p><figure name="4e48" id="4e48" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2RQPINxYeUS97QCHXE_S8A.jpeg" data-width="507" data-height="640" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2RQPINxYeUS97QCHXE_S8A.jpeg"></figure><p name="dea5" id="dea5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As I was reflecting on the session I was thinking that I was aiming the session at students, but the content was perhaps talking too much about organisational transformation. While many ideas are the same for an large scale org transformation and a small scale team organisation, such as thinking about who you want to convince and how you are doing to show them why changing something can benefit and then showing progress on those changes, the session talked too much about organisations and would benefit from more references to personal or team level changes.</p><h4 name="c2d4" id="c2d4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Amazon SES</h4><p name="7867" id="7867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We had an issue with Amazon SES that wasn’t anticipated but the team worked quickly to solve. We have switched to using the Amazon SES service for sending emails, and when testing it on the test system with a load of fake email addresses we managed to suspend the account as the fake email addresses were bouncing. This is another example of taking some time to review a solution first can have benefits over rushing in first. Although this sounds very “waterfall” the approach does show in various Agile methods through using a “spike” to do some initial investigation first. The GDS phase approach can also work in a similar way to implement some proof of concepts.</p><h4 name="53f7" id="53f7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Things I didn’t do</h4><p name="9610" id="9610" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There are loads of things I didn’t do, as usual. While I can view this negatively I tend to think of it as defining goals for things to be done that week, and then responding to change when high priority tasks come in. The tricky thing is making time to progress towards those goals otherwise life becomes a firefight.</p><h4 name="cd3f" id="cd3f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Weeknotes</h4><p name="2fd9" id="2fd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Even writing weeknotes as a way for me to stop and reflect on what happened that week is becoming a hard thing to do!</p><h4 name="a1d1" id="a1d1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Strategy</h4><p name="2d16" id="2d16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Linked to the branching decision above, and with a few thoughts bubbling around in my head on where we need to get to, I need to put these thoughts down and grab some people’s time to talk through it all.</p><h3 name="4d52" id="4d52" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Lessons learned</h3><p name="4fff" id="4fff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Clarity and clutter is an important thing I need to keep in mind. The challenge appears all over the place. For example we have been doing decoration at home with lots of painting and plastering. This has meant the need to clear out stuff from the rooms being done, and trying to not put everything back but to clear out old stuff when taking it out and then reviewing it before it goes back again.</p><p name="200e" id="200e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again at work we need to get better at release planning. Need to simplify workflows, be clearer on what is in each release, and focus on the goals we want to achieve in each sprint. All of this is achievable and every week we make improvements.</p><h3 name="5856" id="5856" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Random stuff</h3><h4 name="d33b" id="d33b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">The Dirt</h4><p name="d19e" id="d19e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I watched most of “The Dirt” film/biopic on Netflix on Saturday. As a long term fan of Motley Crue music I was interested in what they had to say, and watched it with a mixture of revulsion and cynicism. How can people live through that mess of a lifestyle and still produce world class music? I know that Nikki nearly (did?) die at one point and there were a few other lucky escapes but it did seem OTT.</p><h4 name="01ae" id="01ae" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Turbo trainer</h4><p name="43fb" id="43fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">On Sunday due to various time constraints I went on a ride on the “<a href="https://www.smartbiketrainers.com/rouvy-augmented-reality-beta-6262" data-href="https://www.smartbiketrainers.com/rouvy-augmented-reality-beta-6262" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">South Fork Smith River</a>” augmented reality ride as a steady training ride. However, not too far in my competitive side kicks in as I saw some other riders on the course, so I ended up pushing it and ending the ride in a sweaty mess.</p><p name="947f" id="947f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Also interesting to see the <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/road/article/20190328-road-Rosamund-Bradbury-and-Cameron-Jeffers-win-maiden-eRacing-championship-titles-0" data-href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/road/article/20190328-road-Rosamund-Bradbury-and-Cameron-Jeffers-win-maiden-eRacing-championship-titles-0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">British Cycling e-racing championships</a> come to a finale. It got me thinking about how you would train differently for those over outside races.</p></div></div></section>
