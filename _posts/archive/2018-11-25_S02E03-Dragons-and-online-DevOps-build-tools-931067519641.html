So lots of jumpers and paracetamol.</p><h4 name="1091" id="1091" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Good things that happened this week:</h4><p name="f954" id="f954" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The week started visiting the National Software Academy for their official opening event. I continue to be impressed with the setup. Their intention is to produce graduates who are skilled and ready to work. This shows through everything they do — they have great offices (rather than lecture halls) in Newport, so the students have to commute and are expected to work on their degree through constant 2 weeks sprints. It is no wonder that there are loads of companies looking to work with them. I think we need more of this, especially in South Wales to help create more people working in software teams.</p><figure name="5319" id="5319" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*y-YqOKAmMeEPBHPT.jpg" data-width="675" data-height="1000" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*y-YqOKAmMeEPBHPT.jpg"></figure><p name="ff57" id="ff57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">On Thursday we went to a private showing organised by the CSSC, of the new Fantastic Beasts movie. The movie was OK, the plot was alright, and although the CGI was impressive I think it was a bit OTT. More concentration on the plot would have been better, as it felt a bit flat, resting on 1930s Germany-esque style to try and stir emotions.</p><p name="4179" id="4179" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I made more DIY progress this week. Again focussing on some deliveries, almost thought about as a weekly sprint with a sprint goal to achieve. I haven’t been that nerdy to create a physical board, but there is one in my head :-)</p><p name="7038" id="7038" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ended the week going to the dentist, and was told I have nice clean teeth. I must be doing something right!</p><h4 name="8284" id="8284" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Learning things:</h4><p name="63f3" id="63f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I have been told before that I can be “too nice”. This week I read this article “<a href="https://medium.com/@JessicaLexicus/not-my-problem-a-moral-philosophy-3adde0561cb1" data-href="https://medium.com/@JessicaLexicus/not-my-problem-a-moral-philosophy-3adde0561cb1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Not My Problem: A Moral Philosophy</a>” and have decided to start saying no more, as it will help me and also help others to improve.</p><p name="267f" id="267f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Network consistency is really important these days. I have been trying to run some packer and vagrant builds on my laptop, but they keep failing due to network time outs or proxy issues. Without wishing to sound all “Maslow in the 21st century” a decent network connection should be a no-brainer for technical teams. I feel that I have wasted a significant part of my afternoon dealing with crap networks. I bet my home network is more consistent than the one at work.</p><h4 name="edb9" id="edb9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Next steps:</h4><p name="f21d" id="f21d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Next week has a number of family commitments in the evenings. And more DIY to do.</p><p name="688a" id="688a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Try the packer and vagrant builds on my home laptop. I’ve installed Ubuntu as a dual-boot to get a decent OS for building containers, Windows just doesn’t cut it.</p><p name="131c" id="131c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having said that, I tried the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/" data-href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Azure DevOps</a> platform which looks impressive and easy to use. Integrates well with GitHub, as most online build platforms do, but expected given the MS purchase of GitHub. Tools like Travis CI I have found to be a bit clunky so may make the switch to Azure DevOps. Watch this space.</p><figure name="a73d" id="a73d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*fJIQK1SxHcz89A3LejYoNA.png" data-width="989" data-height="474" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fJIQK1SxHcz89A3LejYoNA.png"></figure></div></div></section>
