We met them near our house and cycled to Tredegar House for a hot chocolcate. On the way back we saw some birds that looked like they could walk on water.</p><figure name="5cc5" id="5cc5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bEDJJXBB_5MhPqdSrzck8Q.jpeg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bEDJJXBB_5MhPqdSrzck8Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Birds that can walk on water, or the water is frozen</figcaption></figure><p name="cf31" id="cf31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This main focus for this week has been about backlog refinement and release planning. The teams have been working through sprint backlogs and making progress. However there have been times where it is not clear when stories are “done done” or just “done”, and when people are juggling more than one task at a time. I have tried to challenge both in a similar way by focussing the daily standups on asking people how tickets can be “done done”, what is stopping it from getting there, and if there are other people who can help.</p><p name="ac41" id="ac41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because the teams are distributed I have been sharing the Jira boards on the calls so that people can see the state of the board and we can discuss what work needs to be done. For remote calls it is easy to fall into looking at a blank screen, or even worse being distracted by other screens and not thinking about the work in progress.</p><p name="20e4" id="20e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had sprint planning too this week. It involved tidying up the old sprints that had tickets in various states of progress. The sprint planning sessions went well, again using screen sharing to work through the tickets, and the new sprints were started quickly.</p><p name="56a4" id="56a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I rode into work today with Strava switched on to see how far my commute actually is (it is a full 50% further than I thought — 1.5 miles instead of 1 mile) and I will probably look at my average speed, Strava segments and so on. My competitive edge will kick in no doubt as I try to get PBs on segments on my little Brompton. The wet weather and soggy leaves on the ground this morning made the ride a bit more fun too.</p><h3 name="42db" id="42db" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Things for next week</h3><p name="8e6b" id="8e6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I need to look at communicating my strategy and plans for the Dev team. There are a number of areas to improve on, and given the small team it will be a matter of carefully targetting the high priority changes.</p><p name="80d5" id="80d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sprint planning will need to be improved quickly. Given the clean ups needed, and some resetting of teams, I decided not to use estimating at all for now (I am not a fan of time-based estimates, and story points will need some explanation). However as we continue release planning, and the need to communicate release dates to clients for their planning, we will need to get backlog and sprint estimation improved to drive the release forecasting.</p><p name="65a3" id="65a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to look at ways to do retros for remote teams. There are some options to explore including video conferencing (using webcams as we don’t have fancy video conferencing suites, although they are always a PITA to use), on-screen shared whiteboards, or some other approach. The same thoughts for sprint planning too.</p><p name="8dc7" id="8dc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Need to get the office coffee machine going again.</p><figure name="5a66" id="5a66" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*jq6zw4sARVLfPf8e" data-width="4145" data-height="6217" data-unsplash-photo-id="N3btvQ51dL0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*jq6zw4sARVLfPf8e"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nate_dumlao?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@nate_dumlao?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Nathan Dumlao</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3 name="e8ee" id="e8ee" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Things I have learned</h3><p name="261e" id="261e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I need to do more training on the bike and turbo.</p><p name="8649" id="8649" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Discussions with remote teams need preparation to make sure the messaging and communication are clear. For now I have been using PowerPoint to document my thoughts to explain to people, and then editing the slides during the conversation. Sort of as a whiteboard substitute.</p><p name="51de" id="51de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Even though January (and hence dry January) has ended I have not jumped back on the booze. I didn’t lose any weight though as I think I substituted booze for all the chocolate left over from Xmas.</p></div></div></section>
