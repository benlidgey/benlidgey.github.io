This week has focused a lot on engaging with remote team members.

As with every retro we needed to involve the whole team, some of whom are remote. While this can be done with screen sharing it is hard to keep the engagement going, and difficult to use some retro techniques that involve lots of visuals such as Sailboat or Iceberg.</p><p name="32c8" id="32c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is also difficult to make sure everyone is involved — the conversation can be taken over by individuals who are keen to make their point heard, missing out on feedback and ideas from more introverted team members.</p><p name="58a6" id="58a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some online tools may be useful, like <a href="http://cardboardit.com" data-href="http://cardboardit.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cardboardit.com</a> and that would require organising and coaching for people to use it to remotely put “post-its” on the board at the same time.</p><p name="5865" id="5865" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is something I continue to look at, not only for retros but for general remote team interaction.</p><h3 name="fac5" id="fac5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Release planning</h3><p name="90d2" id="90d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We had release planning meeting this week for a new feature we are starting to work on. I printed out the cards from Jira, and then we had a discussion on the way the stories would best be handled to deliver usable features for each release, building on the previous release, allowing focused development and testing.</p><figure name="c260" id="c260" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*h8pKGZiqp4oIKT08ZUMu-g.jpeg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*h8pKGZiqp4oIKT08ZUMu-g.jpeg"></figure><p name="9f2d" id="9f2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The meeting was done in the office, as you can see, and was productive. However it meant the remote team members were not involved, so there needs to be a separate call to update them on the thinking for the release plan.</p><h3 name="df38" id="df38" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Recycling and charities</h3><p name="3c7c" id="3c7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Today I found out that last year through the sale of items we donated to Tenovus and Ty Hafan charities we raised over £100 for each charity (and the Gift Aid they can claim on top). We had a clear out of things at home that we no longer needed and donated them to the charities. It is great to think that we not only recycled items that would otherwise have gone in the bin, but also raised money for 2 worthwhile charities. It is something I intend to keep doing.</p><h3 name="c06f" id="c06f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cardiff car free day</h3><p name="d433" id="d433" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">On Sunday 12th we went into town for the Cardiff Car Free day. There were various routes around town closed to cars and buses, and instead set up for cyclists. There were stalls from mainly cycle businesses. It seemed quieter than last year.</p><p name="6eef" id="6eef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I felt that it lacked purpose and was more of a box ticking exercise. There was a theme of encouraging people to cycle, which is valuable, but I think it missed out on making a more important, wider message. Cardiff council need to be strong and lead on the reduction of traffic in the city — there are various statements and strategic plans but lack any determination to deliver.</p><p name="e9bd" id="e9bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Instead of encouraging people to cycle the event should be much braver and really champion the benefits to people, the city and the environment of using public transport, walking and cycling to travel into and around the city.</p></div></div></section>
