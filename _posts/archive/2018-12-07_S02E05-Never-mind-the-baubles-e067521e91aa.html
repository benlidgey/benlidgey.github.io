I had a particularly annoying session where I just couldn’t get the site working, and instead kept getting 404 Page Not Found. After a night’s sleep (typically) I somehow noticed that I had missed the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">@Controller</em> annotation off (or removed it by accident). Adding it back in made things work again. Sigh. However as part of the reading and Googling to try and solve the problem I learned some more about the Spring</p><p name="c886" id="c886" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week also saw a final push to introducing trunk-based development. This will make implementing the CD builds in Concourse easier, as it is supported out of the box, will streamline the release process and hopefully remove some of the confusion over how releasing, branching and merging works. The current repos use GitHub Flow, which invariably leads to long-lived release branches, broken builds, and complex build tool configuration to cope with all the feature branches. It is very clear though that the most important parts to get right are the cultural and communication/coaching tasks so people know how trunk-based works, how releases will be made, and what the principles are (no long lived branches etc.).</p><p name="7797" id="7797" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had 2 Xmas concerts to go to on Wednesday evening this week. Luckily my son was performing in the band at the school concert early on in the evening so we could then leave and rush across town to the WNO Community Chorus Xmas concert in the Coal Exchange. We made both concerts and enjoyed them both — my son played guitar very well, and my wife sang very well! The Coal Exchange is a wonderful building, and it is great to see it back from the dereliction.</p><figure name="6f00" id="6f00" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*EPfpFh5WyO076cmLeSEk4Q.jpeg" data-width="640" data-height="383" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EPfpFh5WyO076cmLeSEk4Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Latin phrase on the clock in the Coal Exchange was appropriate on Wednesday</figcaption></figure><p name="4ca7" id="4ca7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Today is my 6th year after surgery for cancer. The day often springs up on me, but then when I realise, I think about how lucky I am and how it has changed my focus on life, and what great support I had from the NHS, Velindre, Tenovus and friends and family.</p><h4 name="26ad" id="26ad" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Things I learned</h4><p name="e38f" id="e38f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Leaving home at 0730 means I hit traffic anyway. It used to be OK to leave then and miss slow, queuing traffic onto the A48, but not anymore. More new houses are being built, and no real improvements in public transport. The sooner they build the “quick win” train station that has been talked about for years the better.</p><p name="5b49" id="5b49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am crap at web design.</p><p name="8ef9" id="8ef9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lots of Google products are in a mess. I have had a Google Apps account for a while, but it feels left out in the cold now. Lots of new Google functionality doesn’t support Google Apps, so I am now working out how to migrate everything to a “normal” Google account. There is no tool to manage the migration either.</p><h4 name="d691" id="d691" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Things coming next</h4><p name="cf3c" id="cf3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Off to London on Saturday to chaperone my daughter and some others to the National Orchestra For All session in Camden. While I am in London I will meet up with my old mate from Uni and my sister, making the most of the trip, as the trouble with London is that it is so far away from everywhere.</p><p name="b7b0" id="b7b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Xmas decorations. I am not that fussed about Xmas decorations. My neighbours have started their annual competition about who can hang more lights on their house, and in work the different teams are dressing up their areas with Xmas decorations. As part of the DevOps team the geek in me is thinking about writing a Terraform script to provision Xmas decorations, or to change the background of the dashboards to a snowy scene.</p><p name="8b43" id="8b43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Probably more decorating next week.</p></div></div></section>
