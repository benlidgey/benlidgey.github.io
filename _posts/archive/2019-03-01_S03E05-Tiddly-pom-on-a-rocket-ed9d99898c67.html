This week has been about short term and long term flow.

Work is (mostly) flowing left to right, sh*t is getting done, and people are asking for more work all the time. All that is great news, and it has shifted the focus onto getting things ready for the new sprint next week.</p><figure name="ac48" id="ac48" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*tcvLTRm7zglIGfVa" data-width="3892" data-height="2586" data-unsplash-photo-id="0b5g9_pnMqc" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tcvLTRm7zglIGfVa"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kydroon?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@kydroon?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Kurt Cotoaga</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3 name="6f0f" id="6f0f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Backlog refinement</h3><p name="1306" id="1306" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We have now made time for more backlog refinement. There are still some unknowns that may change the priorities before next week’s sprint planning sessions, but on the whole the backlogs are in good shapes.</p><h3 name="fa27" id="fa27" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Speed bumps</h3><p name="4b44" id="4b44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As there are new-ish people in the small team we are hitting some impediments where knowledge is in people’s heads. We all have our versions of <a href="http://devopsdictionary.com/wiki/Brent" data-href="http://devopsdictionary.com/wiki/Brent" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brent</a>.</p><p name="b792" id="b792" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There have been some excellent sessions from the Brents to share their knowledge on topics with others. It has also highlighted the need for an appropriate level of documentation.</p><h3 name="818d" id="818d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What “Kan-be-dan” (say it in a Cockney accent)</h3><p name="fedc" id="fedc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Some project workflow is a fairly simple flow focussing on getting work done, and moving it left to right. Some workflows aren’t so simple. Whileit is tempting to tinker with the workflow definitions I think it is better to stop and think about what are we trying to achieve.</p><h4 name="40fa" id="40fa" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Reduce Rework (re)Cycle</h4><p name="794d" id="794d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Dev work is finished and builds completed in the afternoon GMT so the QA team in India can test when they start the working day at some early hour of the morning GMT-time.</p><p name="d551" id="d551" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then at the daily standup we look at the work in progress and discuss any findings from QA. There is a perception that there is a fair amount of rework, but as of yet we have not measured it.</p><p name="a745" id="a745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I raised the question on the Slack channel for the South Wales Agile Group and had some interesting comments on whether there should be a “reopened” status, or if there are other ways to track rework. My gut feel is that a story should remain “in progress” while dev and QA work is being done and tools like the Control Chart can be used to identify longer running stories, and then we can look at why that happened.</p><p name="4c2b" id="4c2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order for that to work though, people in the team need to get to grips more with the Lean and Kanban concepts of continual flow. In the shorter term we can get immediate value by introducing a “reopened” status and tracking the amount of tickets passing through that status in a sprint. As we use Jira this can be done by using a query along the lines of</p><blockquote name="4897" id="4897" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">project = WIDGET AND status was Reopened AND sprint in openSprints() ORDER BY priority DESC, key ASC</blockquote><p name="dedd" id="dedd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We can use that in the forthcoming retros to look at the tickets that were reopened and why that was the case.</p><h3 name="8ec4" id="8ec4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Looking ahead</h3><p name="341a" id="341a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As the amount of work being discussed and agreed continues to increase, as well as getting better at backlog refinement and release planning I am looking more at how we can improve productivity (and reduce any rework). This includes looking at how code changes are tested, built and deployed (we have good build pipelines and automatic deployments, but not so great on automated testing or visualising the test and quality metrics). There are some quick wins there already.</p><p name="3e0e" id="3e0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also we need to make more use of “feature flags”. For the new features o changes, or partial features or changes, that are defined we can start work on those, use the flags to turn them on for QA and UAT, and off for production. While those known changes are being made we can then plan the rest of the changes that need to be done to complete the feature set. There is also the benefit of demo’ing the partial changes on a UAT environment to the clients to get earl feedback. Eventually we can get to canary releases, A/B testing and all that good stuff.</p><h3 name="68d4" id="68d4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">And finally…</h3><p name="013d" id="013d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The weekend arrives. I was planning to go for a decent bike ride this weekend, but two things happened: I managed to break my rear brake blocks changing the rear wheel for the turbo trainer and so need to replace them, and the weather forecast looks pants. I might have to fire up <a href="https://rouvy.com/en/" data-href="https://rouvy.com/en/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rouvy </a>and go for a ride in Hawaii instead. Not quite the same as South Wales but it will have to do.</p><figure name="0950" id="0950" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Hh3HRLJIxcq_vxfWwBKFOw.png" data-width="1366" data-height="768" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Hh3HRLJIxcq_vxfWwBKFOw.png"></figure></div></div></section>
