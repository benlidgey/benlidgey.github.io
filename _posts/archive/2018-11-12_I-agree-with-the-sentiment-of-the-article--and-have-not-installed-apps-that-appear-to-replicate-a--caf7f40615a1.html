An example is the app that my local council produced to tell me which rubbish bins to put out each week. I don’t often need to know this, and can just look it up on the website if I need to.</p><p name="facc" id="facc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A native app makes sense when it uses functionality from the phone, such as location, images/video, audio, NFC etc. that wouldn’t be as easily available from a website. Examples like Strava, payment systems (Google Pay etc.), and camera/video apps. I think this is often forgotten in the rush to have an app.</p><p name="39a2" id="39a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Perhaps there is a gap for an app to provide notifications from SaaS sites to mobiles, although email can do this, or integration with the sites and apps like WhatsApp.</p></div></div></section>
