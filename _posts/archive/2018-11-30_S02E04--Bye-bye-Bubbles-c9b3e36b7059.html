Bubbles the guinea pig died, aged 6 or 7 (she was a rescue, so we are not entirely sure). Bubbles was getting noticeably older, and on her own after her buddy (Rudolph) died over a year ago. She survived the very cold winter earlier in the year, and the hot summer. I found her passed away in her hutch, asleep and looking very content and at peace with the world. Clearly we have been upset at this, but I think she had a good life with us and won’t have to suffer old age through this coming winter. RIP Bubbles.</p><h3 name="b78a" id="b78a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Good things</h3><p name="d3ed" id="d3ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Had fun with my son having a go at 10-pin bowling. We were both awful, didn’t score any strikes, and didn’t get over 100 points. However we had great fun, and drowned our sorrows with an indulgent milkshake.</p><figure name="5d76" id="5d76" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*cF15jaq8K4kA2uwg1ec0mg.jpeg" data-width="2160" data-height="3840" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cF15jaq8K4kA2uwg1ec0mg.jpeg"></figure><p name="43c5" id="43c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Got my daughter’s wardrobe sorted out, and her stuff moved in. This is the penultimate step to getting her moved completely, and so we can start planning decorating her old room.</p><p name="e18f" id="e18f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Had a constructive session with <a href="https://www.codeherent.tech/" data-href="https://www.codeherent.tech/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codeherent</a> on their new product to edit and manage Terraform scripts. They have taken a bold step in developing the new product, and are doing exactly the right thing in looking for input from users to identify the user needs. I hope it works out for them as their approach and attitude are spot on.</p><p name="63ec" id="63ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We (DevOps team) ended our sprint with successful implementation and migration of the first batch of builds from Jenkins to Concourse. The team have worked hard to sort out, clean up and move the builds for about 6 repos. Comms on the Concourse setup were well-written and communicated, a sandbox environment created for other to learn on, and the Concourse instance was sent to people. It is good to get things started, and the comms have already triggered conversations with another team to start their new micro-services building on the new Concourse infrastructure, rather than the older Jenkins setup, immediately saving rework.</p><figure name="13ab" id="13ab" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XlIYeI-9ftfyvI4RNttzIA.png" data-width="1275" data-height="831" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XlIYeI-9ftfyvI4RNttzIA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Green is the new green</figcaption></figure><p name="42d3" id="42d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">On Thursday I went to <a href="http://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/" data-href="http://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cardiff Met</a> to talk with Ali and Dr Khan about the joint PhD on distributed ledgers. We covered a number of topics and possible scenarios to look at next. I have now booked a number of sessions back at work for Ali to talk over those scenarios with different teams.</p><p name="85e2" id="85e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also on Thursday I talked at an internal showcase event by Digital Services teams to people from the rest of the organisation on what DevOps means. It looks like a tricky concept to explain to technical people, but as the foundations of DevOps are on getting the culture right to focus on small, regular, end to end delivery, it became an easier subject to explain.</p><p name="da9e" id="da9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thursday finished with a work Xmas meal in <a href="https://thepotbistrot.com/" data-href="https://thepotbistrot.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pot Bistro</a>. It is an excellent place to eat, with lovely food and atmosphere. It is just too early to think about Xmas (and I am not fussed about Xmas anyway).</p><p name="bd17" id="bd17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today is the end of <a href="https://uk.movember.com/" data-href="https://uk.movember.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Movember</a> for many people. While I have not been a Mo Bro this year, I am always grateful for those that have. <a href="https://uk.movember.com/" data-href="https://uk.movember.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Movember</a> was a great help in me discovering my cancer 6 years ago, and in general a great cause for raising awareness of men’s health.</p><h3 name="60c0" id="60c0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Learned things</h3><p name="13bd" id="13bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This week I had more problems connecting to GitHub over SSH, which was complicated by proxy configurations being different for the work network, the public network and my home network. It was frustrating to have to change config based not only on location but also on network connections. There must be a more sensible way to manage it.</p><p name="12bb" id="12bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I implemented the <a href="https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven" data-href="https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spotify Maven plugin to build Docker containers</a>, and successfully built and deployed a test container to my Docker Hub account. The plugin is well written and documented, making this an easy thing to do (once stupid network configs were sorted out again).</p><h3 name="56a9" id="56a9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Next things</h3><p name="1ad0" id="1ad0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Next week I have planned sessions to explore the impact of distributed ledgers may (or not) have at Companies House.</p><p name="7d8e" id="7d8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have 2 Xmas concerts to go to on Wednesday — one for my son at school and one for my wife at <a href="https://wno.org.uk/whats-on/christmas-celebration" data-href="https://wno.org.uk/whats-on/christmas-celebration" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welsh National Opera Community Chorus</a>.</p><p name="48b3" id="48b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Next week ends with my 6th anniversary of my cancer surgery, which is something to celebrate!</p></div></div></section>
