The train from Cardiff Central on Saturday went OK: it was nearly on time, and the group of loud Swansea football fans who were drinking all the way were well behaved. Once dropping them off to a NOFA chaperone I was able to spend some time with my best mate and his family in Hitchin. The public transport across London and then the regional trains worked well, and I had a good Saturday catching up with them. On Sunday I took good public transport allowing me to get to south London to see my sister and her family, and then back to Camden. It was a good weekend with stress-free travelling and very nice catching up with people that I don’t get to see as often as I would like.</p><p name="e340" id="e340" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Tuesday I attended a “Problem framing workshop”. The intention is to help people think about the problem they are trying to solve, and not to jump into solutions. In my experience it is easy for people to immediately start thinking about how they are going to solve a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">perceived</em> problem as they want to make “progress”. However this can lead to introducing a solution that does not address the actual problem, or missing out on other solutions. The example I liked what the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cobra effect</a>” (or “Rat effect” to widen out the culprits) as it not only was a good example of not thinking about unintended consequences but also a example of arrogant management (not leadership).</p><p name="aeee" id="aeee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Wednesday I was part of a showcase within Digital Services to show to the main board all of the work and initiatives that are done in Digital Services. My little part was to introduce the concept and principles for DevOps to a group of mainly non-technical people in 5 minutes, which was a challenge to balance the technical and cultural aspects. Given the audience I focussed more on the cultural benefits as I think telling them all about ansible/terraform/continual delivery would have made them sleepy. The feedback for the overall event was very positive as they were not aware of it all, and highlighted the need for us to communicate more clearly what we are all doing.</p><p name="1b93" id="1b93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thursday was somewhat dominated by supporting the group who have been doing the “Coach to 5k” programme on their final 5k run around Bute Park. I haven’t done any serious exercise for a while, and so was nervous about doing it. I found it enjoyable running with a group in the clear, cold air away from all the traffic fumes. The group have shown amazing determination to stick with the programme. When I say the day was dominated that’s because my body isn’t used to running 5k, and so I felt the effects for the rest of the day.</p><figure name="c22b" id="c22b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Ku6kxEsSwKHOQGRYxpOOXA.jpeg" data-width="640" data-height="617" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ku6kxEsSwKHOQGRYxpOOXA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Struggling with the finishing banner</figcaption></figure><p name="2264" id="2264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">My ongoing task this week has been talking to people to define a “pre-flight checklist” for teams when starting new pieces of work, and potential to use a periodic refresher. The basic premise is to provide prompts for outcomes to be achieved, such as “has the technical stack been defined and agreed”, “is there a release plan”, or “have the team installed the latest developer tools”, and links and references to the up to date documentation, such as coding standards, security standards. While it can be useful it only has value when people agree that it is valuable and it is used and updated regularly. Enforcing that would not work, so a large part of the work will be getting engagement and buy-in.</p><h3 name="cb6c" id="cb6c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Things that I have learned</h3><p name="5461" id="5461" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I need to make more family and personal time. I have been looking at the Tour de Gwent as the first personal target for 2019. As it has many different routes it could be a good event to train for for myself and my kids.</p><p name="032f" id="032f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public transport is great when it is working. The Cardiff public transport is poor. There is lots of talk about the <a href="https://tfw.gov.wales/projects/south-wales-metro" data-href="https://tfw.gov.wales/projects/south-wales-metro" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">South Wales Metro</a> and how wonderful it will be, but I have not seen any action.</p><p name="bf99" id="bf99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cobra’s should be shown more love and not mercilessly killed.</p><p name="9182" id="9182" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Social pressures, such as needing to put up more Christmas lights than the neighbours, should be ignored. If they want to do that then fine, but I don’t really see the value in it (i.e. I don’t give a shit).</p><figure name="5b07" id="5b07" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/bHSCxaHfjZYwE/twitter/iframe" width="435" height="261" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h3 name="bdbb" id="bdbb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Things coming next</h3><p name="8d3e" id="8d3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I need to do more DIY and moving rooms to get my son into his room by Christmas. This means someone else will need to put up the Christmas decorations and tree.</p><p name="7c00" id="7c00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The run up to Christmas next week will require a focus on getting things done that can be achieved with the right people, or postponing until January.</p></div></div></section>
