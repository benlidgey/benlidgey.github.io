The Ikea TV unit was a right b**tard to put together as the instructions were not clear at all, and we were seconds away from taking it back when I thought I would experiment and try one last thing. That worked and we got the unit together.</p><p name="6096" id="6096" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we approach starting some exciting projects at work we have been involved in the planning and roadmap work. I gave a quick overview of story mapping (maybe a bit too quick thinking about it), and we talked about personas. They are both useful ways to think about the user’s needs, and something we will continue next week, even for some work for the mobile apps that look simple. For example we are implementing some guided tours in the apps, one for new app installations and one for new feature releases. They look similar as there will be “cards” presenting information, but when you think about it there are 2 different personas: a new user who needs informing how the whole app works, and an existing user who has upgraded and just needs to know about the new features. We can’t just treat it as implementing some cards, but as different journeys with different information needs.</p><p name="82a6" id="82a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The planning and roadmaps have highlighted where our estimating and tracking are letting us down. Some team sprint planning sessions have not had time or enough definition to properly story point work, and the QA team are not available to contribute, so the estimates are not great. They are the best we have at the moment, and we can improve. One project has been story pointing well, and as it is coming to the first major release the version report in Jira has been useful in reviewing the remaining work. This has also helped to show where the other teams need more improvement.</p><p name="6620" id="6620" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This weekend I am planning more outcomes to achieve with home projects, things to do with the family, and even some personal outcomes (there is a long ride on the turbo trainer I want to do to level-up).</p><p name="3bd1" id="3bd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally I found out the source of the photo I have as my desktop wallpaper. A lovely photo of an iconic plane.</p><figure name="b255" id="b255" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*m_u248UBxAgrGnVbXa59iA.png" data-width="1024" data-height="679" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m_u248UBxAgrGnVbXa59iA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://silodrome.com/spitfire-wallpaper/" data-href="https://silodrome.com/spitfire-wallpaper/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://silodrome.com/spitfire-wallpaper/</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
