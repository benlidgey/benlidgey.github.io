The analogy to monetary debt is obvious, although there has been articles discussing the benefits of debt — borrowing money can allow businesses to expand rapidly and win market share.</p><p name="d4fc" id="d4fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tech debt can be used by dev teams as a reason to over-engineer. The classic lines of “we need to design and write this to be exactly right, otherwise we will incur tech debt” are uttered without a thought of business value. This results in longer estimates, longer development and releases, all the while not delivering any value to customers.</p><p name="6ff0" id="6ff0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now consider “tech debt” as part of the decision making process on what to develop and how to develop it. Focussing on delivering value to the customer to meet the required deadlines will necessarily result in some less than perfect implementation (some would call this tech debt), but deliver value. If the focus was on avoiding the tech debt this value may not be delivered.</p><p name="60b0" id="60b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">By keeping the development to just enough to support the MVP, the levels of tech debt incurred will be small enough to manage in the next release.</p></div></div></section>
