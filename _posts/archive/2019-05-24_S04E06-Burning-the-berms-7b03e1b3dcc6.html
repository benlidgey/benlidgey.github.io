I’ve not been mountain biking properly for ages, but loved it. The kit has changed so much! My old mountain bike was a fairly standard shape frame, with similar gear ratios to hybrids, and with slightly wider tyres. The <a href="https://whyte.bike/products/901" data-href="https://whyte.bike/products/901" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Whyte </a>I hired from <a href="http://www.afanvalleybikeshed.co.uk/" data-href="http://www.afanvalleybikeshed.co.uk/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Afan Valley Bike Shed</a> was a lovely bit of kit. Wider tyres, more upright and sat back frame geometry, only 1 front ring and the lowest gear at the back looked larger than the large chain ring on my road bike. It made cycling up the side of a mountain easy — so much so we did it twice. We enjoyed the Widowmaker so much the first time, that the extra effort and leg burns was worth doing to have a second go.</p><p name="9931" id="9931" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a great day out, lovely scenery and sunshine, and had a great time with my son. Next time I might have to hire a full sus.</p><figure name="6c92" id="6c92" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*s2YggVEgtApVB-DhJSAmWA.jpeg" data-width="2201" data-height="1243" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s2YggVEgtApVB-DhJSAmWA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">We made it to The Top and stopped for a snack and drink</figcaption></figure><h3 name="749f" id="749f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Repos for microservices</h3><p name="56dd" id="56dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Had a debate this week about how to manage repositories for micro-services. There are several options with pros and cons. This article “<a href="https://medium.com/@somakdas/code-repository-for-micro-services-mono-repository-or-multiple-repositories-d9ad6a8f6e0e" data-href="https://medium.com/@somakdas/code-repository-for-micro-services-mono-repository-or-multiple-repositories-d9ad6a8f6e0e" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Code repository for micro-services: mono repository or multiple repositories</a>” outlines many of the pros and cons nicely.</p><p name="c08e" id="c08e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My preference is to have a repo for each microservice. The service can be built, released and deployed in a controlled manner. One discussion was that libraries that might be needed to connect with the service might be in a separate repo — the solution I think is to have both the client and server code in the repo. That way the version of each can be managed.</p><h3 name="d1e1" id="d1e1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Releases</h3><p name="56d3" id="56d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We had another discussion this week about release planning, software releases, builds, deployment and releasing code to servers. There is often an overloading of words like “release”:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="7adb" id="7adb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">A release — a set of features that will be discussed and delivered to the customer (“the June release will contain the amazing new feature”)</li><li name="f259" id="f259" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A build of a component or service (“can you release the change you have just committed?”)</li><li name="2960" id="2960" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Putting a build of a component or service onto a server (“can you release version 1.2 to the test server?”)</li></ul><p name="aafa" id="aafa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This has been complicated by the inconsistent naming in Jira — the Agile boards allow the definition of “releases”, with stories being dragged into a release. These are called “fix version”. You can get release notes for the tickets in a release/fix version. Should these “release notes” show the stories and bugs in a version of the software, or for the functionality to be discussed with the customer. The Jira Agile boards don’t help as the release/fix version is overwritten if you drag and drop a ticket, although you can have more than one set on a ticket.</p><p name="0d2a" id="0d2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few weeks ago in <a href="https://weeknot.es/s04e04-positive-introspection-and-adaption-b8e9c0c445b" data-href="https://weeknot.es/s04e04-positive-introspection-and-adaption-b8e9c0c445b" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">S04E04 Positive introspection and adaption</a> I thought about the overloaded use of build too.</p><p name="855c" id="855c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we started a new repo with CI/CD that can automatically update Jira tickets (if the Jira ref is in the commit), we wanted to track the tickets closed in a set of commits. At the same time we need to manage the tickets planned for a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">business release</em> that can be monitored and progress communicated.</p><p name="0748" id="0748" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We decided how it was all going to work, and time will tell if that is the right way to go. Probably more on that at a later date.</p><h3 name="8825" id="8825" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cycling to city centre offices</h3><p name="71d5" id="71d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">We are looking at a potential office move to the city centre. One thing that struck me is the number of adverts that mention car parking but very few mention (secure) cycle parking. It sounds like the council need to put a lot more effort into sustainable transport in the city.</p></div></div></section>
