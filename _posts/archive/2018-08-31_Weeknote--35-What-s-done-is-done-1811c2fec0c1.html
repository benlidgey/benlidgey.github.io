It has been one of those week where I have often been feeling that I have not achieved anything; I have not got things <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">done</em>.</p><p name="065e" id="065e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As Head of DevOps a lot of my job is spent looking at getting things done better and quicker (a bit of a simplification but it will do for now). This means looking at a lot of metrics, data, value streams, thinking about topics like Kanban, work in progress (WIP), and what it means for a task to be <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">done</em>. This is shown in burn down charts, todo lists getting smaller, metrics improving.</p><figure name="e53c" id="e53c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*GtsIllReJf-eqku9Tvu_uA.png" data-width="2458" data-height="1793" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GtsIllReJf-eqku9Tvu_uA.png"></figure><p name="98c3" id="98c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This has rolled over into my personal life too. We have recently had a loft conversion completed, but have not moved our bedroom into it yet because there are a number of jobs that I have not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">done</em>. Things like putting up shelves, lights. Looking at it though, we can move in without the shelves and some lights and those can be done earlier. If we were to define the work in agile terms the MVP may be “have a bed and curtains”, with the backlog for future releases to include shelves and lights. However for this I don’t really care. And here’s why.</p><p name="0d87" id="0d87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At work we are starting on an organisational transformation. I am involved in the people and culture work stream. On Thursday I was facilitating a session with people from all over the organisation on the current culture, the future culture and getting ideas on how to get there. One fairly large topic of conversation was that some parts of the organisation have targets to meet, and this affects people’s perception of what their job is to just meeting the targets and not attending workshops, training, or reading updates on the transformation programme. Their understand of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">doing</em> their jobs was doing the tasks to reach their defined target. The other stuff wasn’t considered as equally valuable tasks to do.</p><figure name="4080" id="4080" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*QwDVISbbKYROLrZE" data-width="5370" data-height="3580" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*QwDVISbbKYROLrZE"><figcaption class="imageCaption">“person holding pencil and stick note beside table” by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@martenbjork?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@martenbjork?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Marten Bjork</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="4d1b" id="4d1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It made me re-think about what I have done this week. I have cooked meals for my family, gone shopping, put fuel in the car, checked bicycles, spent time with my family. Even at work I have done things, like facilitating the workshop, chairing a meeting, discussing upcoming work with team members. All of these things are good things to get <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">done</em>, but are often overlooked as “normal life”. Yet they are still valuable and often necessary.</p><p name="990b" id="990b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So my challenge to you is to think about <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">all</strong> the things you have <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">done</em> this week, and not just the “big ticket” items. I bet you have <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">done</strong> a lot. I know I have.</p><p name="3d6a" id="3d6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over and out.</p><figure name="441c" id="441c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DIAyzJg5HP6ICOeFKiqvcA.jpeg" data-width="5824" data-height="3884" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DIAyzJg5HP6ICOeFKiqvcA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/iaSzwYccV28?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/photos/iaSzwYccV28?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Masaaki Komori</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/finish?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/finish?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
