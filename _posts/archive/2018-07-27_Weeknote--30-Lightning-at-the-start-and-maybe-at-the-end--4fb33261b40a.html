The feedback so far has been positive, with the audience liking the content and the format. There were only a few minor technical hiccups, which is always nice when dealing with multiple presentations, projectors, audio and video conferencing.</p><p name="59ea" id="59ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a little side-tip: I used <a href="https://picsum.photos/" data-href="https://picsum.photos/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lorem Picsum</a> to download some random images to use for a rolling presentation to run in the background before the actual presentations started. It was tempting to challenge someone from the audience to do an off-the-cuff lightning talk based on the random images, but that would probably have been mean.</p><pre name="c7c6" id="c7c6" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">https://picsum.photos/200/300/?random</code></pre><p name="f8d1" id="f8d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">From that positive start to the week, things continued to get better. Everyday various plans at home and work became clearer. I have been trying to start everyday with a little quiet time to look at what needs to be done that day, and focus on a small number of prioritised tasks (in a stop starting and start finishing way).</p><p name="e934" id="e934" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The DevOps backlog refinement continued, with clearer definitions of goals (based on OKRs) to achieve. I still like the OKR concept as it provides clear, short to medium goals and metrics to measure the progress towards those goals. It aligns well with the open and transparent principles of Agile and DevOps.</p><p name="4733" id="4733" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have also been using <a href="http://coggle.it" data-href="http://coggle.it" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coggle.it</a> to document the different Agile frameworks. It has been a useful exercise for me to learn about the different approaches, and the similarities between things like Scrum, Kanban, SaFe and LeSS. If you are interested, take a look <a href="https://coggle.it/diagram/W1HW8a_5Paxz-0nG/t/agile-frameworks" data-href="https://coggle.it/diagram/W1HW8a_5Paxz-0nG/t/agile-frameworks" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p name="e6e7" id="e6e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The car went in for a service too without any major issues. It also gave me a chance to ride my Brompton through the park to work on a lovely sunny day. The Brompton is a wonderful piece of engineering — simple and functional. Riding through the park is so much nicer than breathing in traffic fumes.</p><figure name="5003" id="5003" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*1LSEEnV5VgT24hbjUG1bSA.png" data-width="1606" data-height="1617" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1LSEEnV5VgT24hbjUG1bSA.png"></figure><p name="30e6" id="30e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">And now it looks like it is going to rain. And hopefully some great big, exciting thunderstorms (with lightning).</p></div></div></section><section name="00ed" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="168e" id="168e" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">What I learned this week</h3><p name="b1d9" id="b1d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Visuals are very powerful ( I already knew this, but the Lightning Talks and mind maps reiterated it).</p><p name="7dc2" id="7dc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taking some quiet time to stop and think about what needs to be done, coupled with some simple goals to achieve is worthwhile. This can be at a personal level, daily level and weekly level. This clarity has been positive for me to focus on what is important.</p><p name="f68c" id="f68c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">A positive start to each day, and the week can be a powerful force.</p></div></div></section>
