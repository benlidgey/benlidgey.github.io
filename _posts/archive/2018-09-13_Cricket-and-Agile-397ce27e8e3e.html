Some similarities popped into my head, so I thought I would explore the analogy here and see what happens.</p><figure name="bccb" id="bccb" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/jsTgk136sV71K/twitter/iframe" width="435" height="326" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h3 name="1770" id="1770" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">What is value?</h3><p name="d888" id="d888" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The focus in Agile development is on maximising the value delivered to the customer. But what does value mean in cricket? I am going with:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3b6f" id="3b6f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The batting side value is in the runs scored against the number of wickets lost. The more runs per wicket the more value.</li><li name="9c92" id="9c92" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The bowling side value is the inverse — the number of wickets taken against the number of runs conceded.</li></ul><h3 name="9a0b" id="9a0b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Fixed time and cost</h3><p name="c2fd" id="c2fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Agile operates on the premise that the time and costs are fixed, and that the scope can vary. That gives the customer a known cost (because it is fixed) and the team the ability to respond to change by varying or changing the scope. This can be bringing in higher-value work, re-prioritising the existing work or adding more item to the backlog as the scope becomes clearer. If the team solve all the problems quickly to the customer’s satisfaction then the work can finish sooner. But it will never go over the fixed time and cost (the customer may want more work done, in which case there are discussions around the next fixed time and cost period).</p><p name="bef8" id="bef8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cricket has fixed time and cost. It doesn’t matter if you are talking about T20, 50 overs or Test cricket, there is a fixed time box within which the match will finish.</p><h3 name="0afc" id="0afc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Vary scope</h3><p name="6220" id="6220" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As mentioned above the scope of the work can vary to keep the time and costs fixed. Relating this to cricket can be tricky. If we consider the scope to be the number of runs required to win the match, then the scope can arguably be fixed also. Team A score 350 runs, therefore Team B need to score 351 within the allotted time to win — no ability to vary the scope.</p><p name="4b5e" id="4b5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is where the beloved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckworth%E2%80%93Lewis_method" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckworth%E2%80%93Lewis_method" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Duckworth-Lewis</a> method can come to the rescue (a phrase not always heard). When a team batting 2nd has the innings interrupted by bad weather, the D-L statistical method is used to calculate a revised score for that team to achieve based on the remaining overs. Therefore the scope is changed.</p><h3 name="01f3" id="01f3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Sprint planning</h3><p name="7ae2" id="7ae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Before a sprint starts the team review the backlog with the Product Owner and commit to an agreed amount of work that is understood by the team to deliver in the next sprint.</p><p name="1ca9" id="1ca9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before an over the cricket captain reviews the batsmen currently in, the state of the pitch and ball, the fitness of his bowlers and other factors such as the score, weather and so on. He commits to a bowler and bowling tactics for the forthcoming over.</p><h3 name="4b0d" id="4b0d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Sprints</h3><p name="e3ef" id="e3ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Scrum uses iterations or sprints to manage a small amount of work that the team commit to completing in a fixed time period. The team’s focus is on completing that work within the sprint.</p><p name="5f28" id="5f28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cricket has an iteration, referred to as an over. An over is a fixed number of balls (6) that are bowled at the opposing batsmen. The fielding team commit to a single bowler delivering those 6 balls, and the team adjust their fielding positions to attempt to get the opposition batsmen out. During the over the captain acts as a Scrum Master to help the team get the batsmen out by altering field positions.</p><p name="b379" id="b379" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The batting side commit the 2 batsmen who are in to the over. They adjust their batting tactics based on the position of the fielders and the bowling.</p><h3 name="60fe" id="60fe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Retrospectives</h3><p name="3e3a" id="3e3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After the sprint the team conduct a (very quick) retrospective to inspect their progress, identify anything that went well and any improvements that need to be made.</p><p name="a346" id="a346" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of the over the fielding captain, with consultation with other players, quickly review the progress in that over, and decide what to do in the next over — does the tactics stay the same, are the bowlers and field positions changed, responding to the outcome of the over that has just finished.</p><p name="b59b" id="b59b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similarly you will see the batsmen conferring at the end of an over, discussing what happened in that over and what is coming up in the next one, and any longer term tactics needed, such as scoring more aggressively.</p><h3 name="69b5" id="69b5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Releases</h3><p name="2977" id="2977" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Releases are planned with the Product Owner and team so that the value in the completed changes can be delivered to the customer.</p><p name="91eb" id="91eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cricket innings deliver the value (runs) to the batting side. The release only happens when all the wickets are lost, or in limited-overs when all the overs are completed. For the fielding side, a release is made when all the opposition batsmen are out, or in limited-overs when all the overs are completed.</p><h3 name="1c59" id="1c59" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="3fd4" id="3fd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m not really sure where this has got anyone. I suspect it is an analogy that is stretched too far, and probably worth avoiding. A bit like a Stuart Broad bouncer.</p><figure name="bf01" id="bf01" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p graf--trailing"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/105Kl0qapcCOdy/twitter/iframe" width="435" height="245" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure></div></div></section>
