# Burndowns in real life

This week I have been taking part in Movember 150 to support men's health week. The aim is to cycle 150km between 14th and 20th June. So being the agile nerd I am I decided to plan my progress during the week and track my progress using some agile techniques.

# Backlog

I have a fixed delivery date of 20th June. Measuring my value in km I need to deliver a fixed scope/value of 150km by that date. I have a fixed team capacity too (just me). That doesn't give me any flexiblilty in the overall scope -- my "[iron triangle](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/agile-iron-triangle)" is well and truly double-butted welded.

Looking at it a different way though, the high-level requirements are to "deliver" 150km; how this is achieved is still up to me. So I planned a backlog of routes and rides over the week that would add up to the 150km. 

I started with the aim of scheduling Zwift meetups so other people can join, and so the choice of routes was not limited to those that are allocated on specific days in Zwift. As it turned out there were few takers for the meetups and I felt it was better to ride in the daily worlds with other people rather than alone on a meetup. This required backlog refinement of routes during the week to adjust the planned routes to others in the allocated worlds.

# WIP limits

My team size is 1 (me). So I can only cycle one route at a time, therefore my in progress WIP limit is 1.

# Inspection

I set up a couple of Google Doc spreadsheets -- one for the backlog of rides and one to track the actual ride length and plot the burndown so I could see if I was on track to cover the distance for the week.

# Ride on!

I started out with all the determination and energy on Monday 14th with the short ride first thing in the morning, and a longer ride in the evening. My energy lasted into Tuesday morning with another gentle ride to keep the kms ticking over. So far so good -- just over 1 day in and 41km done.

Typically the weather was very hot as we had a little June heatwave, so that took more of a toll on me than I had planned. I had to take a break. Time to inspect and adapt. I reviewed the "backlog" of planned routes and dropped the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning rides to give me some time to recover, and adjusted the routes for later in the week so that I was still on track to meet the 150km by Sat 19th to give some contingency.

The hot sunshine went away on Wednesday afternoon to be replaced by more humidity. Wednesday's ride was probably not the best idea to do the "Figure 8 Reverse" around Watopia that included two KOM sections, as I reflected in my retrospective on Wednesday evening. I needed another rest. 

# More inspection and adaption

Looking at the burndown I had now covered 89km after 3 days so still tracking well on the burndown, so missing a ride on Thursday morning should be OK. Let's continue at a sustainable pace and not burnup (see what I did there!). More backlog refinement to remove the Thursday morning ride and juggle the later rides to match the Zwift worlds, taking into the account the distances and climbs (no more KOMs!).

# Refreshed. Ride on!

After the break on Thursday morning I felt refreshed so decided to go on a bit of a badge hunt and went for the "Out and back again" route. I started a bit later in the evening than I meant to, so took a tactical approach starting on a TT bike on the flat roads in the desert and getting a good pace, then switching to a road bike when getting to the rolling climbs. I hadn't done my planning properly again though, as I found out there was a KOM and then the Volcano KOM on the route. I was determined to finish the route and get the badge, so pushed hard and completed 45km and the course. But I was spent. More adjustment meant Friday rides were dropped completely -- the steady sustainable, regular pace had gone really, replaced with a more lumpy intermittent delivery.

# Fresh air and the final ride(s)! 

Then Saturday presented the option to get outside for some smaller rides around the area. I was more focussed on exploring some routes and not measuring the km so was a bit miffed to find out I was 3km short of the 150km target when I got home, but also not too worried as I wanted to finish on a high rather than a short ride around the local area. It did raise the question of forecasting again. The finish came on Sunday when I blasted around the Makuri Islands Three Village Loop on a TT bike, completing 11km in a quick time.

The final graphs are:

# Retrospective

Looking at the week, the things that could have gone better were:

1. Deciding what my approach to the week was -- would I approach it to get the 150km done as quickly and easily as possible on flat routes, long routes, or in a series of shorter rides? Would I want to set additional challenges such as also tracking the amount of climbs, badges, and so on?
2. Talking earlier to other people doing the challenge to get an idea of the interest in online rides, and so whether to arrange meetups or plan rides for me.
3. Researching routes to understand the challenges, such as KOM, climbs and so on before setting out. This would be influenced by my approach.
4. Keeping a steady pace of rides, and making sure there was "booked" time in my week for those rides to happen.
5. Making sure my endurance fitness and preparations (sleep, getting up in time for breakfast for example) are sufficient.

You can see how the length of rides went up and down, and then dropped off after Thursday from the final burndown chart, perhaps indicating I needed more endurance and preparation too.

Things that went well were:

1. Most importantly I attempted the challenge, raised some donations and hopefully raised awareness of men's health.
2. I completed the challenge and enjoyed doing it.
3. I collected some Zwift route badges and green jerseys along the way. I also discovered some local routes, although they were not great and I won't be riding them again, but at least I know that now.
4. I tracked, inspected and adjusted the rides during the week taking into account how I was feeling, other events that influenced if I could make a ride.

If I was to do a similar or longer challenge again I would look to keep the inspection and adaption, and focus on a more sustainable and regular pace. I was able to manage the different length rides for a week because it was a short challenge in terms of time and distance and I am fit enough to catch up when I needed to. A longer challenge would need a consistent delivery. Definitely something I would look to do though.
