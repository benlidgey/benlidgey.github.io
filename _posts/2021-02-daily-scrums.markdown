Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Build projects around motivated individuals.Give them the environment and support they need,and trust them to get the job done.

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

Daily Scrum anti-patterns

Plenty has been written about Daily Scrum anti-patterns, and the “standard 3 questions” update has done more damage to the purpose of the Daily Scrum, and arguably to Scrum itself, than the good. It is often seen as a way for “pointy haired management types” to get progress updates from developers than for the team to organise the work towards achieving value for the customer, and towards delivering the sprint goal.

What about using text-based tools for providing updates instead?

Pros

Team members can provide updates when they are at a suitable point in their day. This can remove possible interruptions to their thought processes.

There is a record of updates for team members who may be unable to attend, or for remote team members in different timezones.

Cons

Updates can be “fire and forget” and more difficult to generate conversations, ideas or spin-off conversations with others.

Engagement with team members can be difficult as team members can skim read or ignore updates from others.
