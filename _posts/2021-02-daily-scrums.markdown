Should we have Daily Scrums if they interrupt people's workflow?

Recently we've been having a debate about the value of a daily scrum and whether it interrupts people's workflow and train of thought, or if that interruption is worth it. In this discussion there were 2 main sides: those in favour of a daily scrum at the same time each day on a Teams call, and those in favour of sharing their update by a message in a shared Teams channel.

Let's look at what the guidance says.

The Agile Manifesto (https://agilemanifesto.org/) talks about "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools" which would suggest we should value the individual(s) preferred way of working over the defined process and tools. 1-0 to the text-update mob.

The Agile Manifesto principles (https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) say "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation." which suggests people should meet up face to face (or virtually in this case for a remote team). 1-1.

It also says "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,and trust them to get the job done." which hints at trusting the team to self-organise for what they need and how they feel is best to work. 1-2 to the text-update mob.

Now let's look at the Scrum Guide (https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum)

"The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers." Now the score is 2-2.

"The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management." We are back to self-organising, so 2-3 to text-updates.

"Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings." Hmm, this is an interesting one, as there is a whole debate behind this about how effective are text-updates for all of that stuff. Can you really identify that someone has an impediment if they say "I am working on resolving the database performance issue"? Or is that more because they need to express their update differently, or someone needs to follow-up on that text update to ask for more information? Is it the fault of text-updates if people just read an update, shrug their shoulders and move on, rather than taking the time to ask if that person needs help, whereas if everyone was face to face would someone be more likely to actually offer their help or ask follow-on questions?

Daily Scrum anti-patterns

Plenty has been written about Daily Scrum anti-patterns, and the “standard 3 questions” update has done more damage to the purpose of the Daily Scrum, and arguably to Scrum itself, than the good. It is often seen as a way for “pointy haired management types” to get progress updates from developers than for the team to organise the work towards achieving value for the customer, and towards delivering the sprint goal. This has been one point used against having a daily scrum, as it is seen as a boring ritual rather than delivering any value. Firing off a quick text-update in a few seconds can achieve the same outcome without having to stand through 14 minutes of other people mumbling what they did yesterday.

What about using text-based tools for providing updates instead?

Pros

Team members can provide updates when they are at a suitable point in their day. This can remove possible interruptions to their thought processes.

There is a record of updates for team members who may be unable to attend, or for remote team members in different timezones.

Cons

Updates can be “fire and forget” and more difficult to generate conversations, ideas or spin-off conversations with others.

Engagement with team members can be difficult as team members can skim read or ignore updates from others.
