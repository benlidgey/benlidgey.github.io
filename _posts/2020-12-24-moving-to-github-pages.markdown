I have started to migrate my posts from [medium.com/@benlidgey](https://medium.com/@benlidgey) to my GitHub pages. The main reason is that I wanted greater control over my content. I wasn't sure what changes were planned at [medium.com](http://medium.com) for content access, and I want to have greater flexibility on the content I can put together.

I have exported my posts, which was easy to do, and am now looking if I need to edit or tidy them up, or whether I can just dump them here and move forward. I must admit the latter option is appealing at the moment.

The move to GitHub Pages was not as a smooth as I had anticipated. There were a few wrinkles in the tutorials and steps for setting up Jekyll to write and test locally, while they were not difficult to fix were annoying and I suspect would put some people off.
