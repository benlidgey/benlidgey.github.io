# Should we have Daily Scrums if they interrupt people's workflow?

Recently we've been having a debate about the value of a daily scrum and whether it interrupts people's workflow and train of thought, or if that interruption is worth it. In this discussion there were 2 main sides: those in favour of a daily scrum at the same time each day on a Teams call, and those in favour of sharing their update by a message in a shared Teams channel.

## Let's look at what the guidance says

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) talks about 

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

which would suggest we should value the individual(s) preferred way of working over the defined process and tools. 1-0 to the text-update mob.

The [Agile Manifesto principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) say 

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

which suggests people should meet up face to face (or virtually in this case for a remote team). 1-1.

It also says 

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,and trust them to get the job done.

which hints at trusting the team to self-organise for what they need and how they feel is best to work. 1-2 to the text-update mob.

Now let's look at the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum)

> The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

Now the score is 2-2.

> The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

We are back to self-organising, so 2-3 to text-updates. It goes on to say:

> Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

Hmm, this is an interesting one, as there is a whole debate behind this about how effective are text-updates for all of that stuff. Can you really identify that someone has an impediment if they say "I am working on resolving the database performance issue"? Or is that more because they need to express their update differently, or someone needs to follow-up on that text update to ask for more information? Is it the fault of text-updates if people just read an update, shrug their shoulders and move on, rather than taking the time to ask if that person needs help, whereas if everyone was face to face would someone be more likely to actually offer their help or ask follow-on questions?

This feels like one of those "refer to the TV official" moments, so could be 3-3, or stay at 2-3.

## Daily Scrum anti-patterns

Plenty has been written about Daily Scrum anti-patterns, and the “standard 3 questions” update has done more damage to the purpose of the Daily Scrum, and arguably to Scrum itself, than the good. It is often seen as a way for “pointy haired management types” to get progress updates from developers than for the team to organise the work towards achieving value for the customer, and towards delivering the sprint goal. This has been one point used against having a daily scrum, as it is seen as a boring ritual rather than delivering any value. Firing off a quick text-update in a few seconds can achieve the same outcome without having to stand through 14 minutes of other people mumbling what they did yesterday.

There are plenty of articles and blogs on daily scrum anti-patterns, with recommendations on what to do about them, such as this one: https://age-of-product.com/stand-up-anti-patterns/

Ultimately, I think there is a more fundamental issue where "Agile" or "Scrum" is introduced to an organisation without enough explanation, training or coaching for *everyone* on why it is being used, what the principles are, what the allowed behaviours are (such as the Development team leading the Daily Scrum and feeling psychologically safe to remind people outside of the team who may be there that they are only watching).

# What about using text-based tools for providing updates instead?

The suggestion was made to use a text-based messaging tool to provide updates to the team instead at roughly the same time of day, but not exactly the same time of day to allow for people to stop their work at a suitable breakpoint. We debated this as a team.

The advantages are:

* Team members can provide updates when they are at a suitable point in their day. This can remove possible interruptions to their thought processes.
* There is a record of updates for team members who may be unable to attend.
* Remote team members in different timezones can contribute when appropriate for them.

The disadvantages we identified are:

* Updates can be “fire and forget” brief updates, with one or two sentences on what someone is doing. This can lead to the individual updates anti-pattern. 
* It is more difficult to generate conversations, ideas or spin-off conversations with others.

My observations are:

* There is not an opportunity for the team to reflect on the current work and if it is aligned to the sprint goal.
* Engagement with team members can be difficult as team members can skim read or ignore updates from others.
* There is less focus on the flow of work in the sprint, as we cannot esaily view the work in progress, ask what is being blocked and what needs to be done to complete tasks (pull from right to left). This has to be done on an individual basis. It is evidenced by the sprint burndown chart flatlining.
* For a team that has been forced into remote working during the pandemic it has removed a regular opportunity for the team to come together (virtually). We will have to see what affect that has on the team and individual wellbeing.

# How is it going?

We have done a couple of sprints so far with text-based updates, and the team is generally happy with the approach. As someone in the Scrum Master role I feel the collective team view of the sprint goal, and the ability for the team to change the focus of the conversation to what is important that day is lost. The status updates feel very individual, and reverting more towards the "I did this, am doing that" format the team were trying to avoid in the first place.

Ultimately though the team are keen to keep the text-based updates, and as long as things are working, the team are self-organising and I am also able to get the information I need to fulfill my responsibilities then it is not for me to change it.
